| [MyIniKey](https://keensoftwarehouse.github.io/SpaceEngineersModAPI/api/VRage.Game.ModAPI.Ingame.Utilities.MyIniKey.html) | key |     |

##### Returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| System.Boolean |     |

### Operators

#### Equality(MyIniKey, MyIniKey)

Checks the two given [MyIniKey](https://keensoftwarehouse.github.io/SpaceEngineersModAPI/api/VRage.Game.ModAPI.Ingame.Utilities.MyIniKey.html)s for equality. Note that this is equality in the sense of a configuration key, which means the comparison is implicitly case insensitive.

##### Declaration

```
public static bool operator ==(MyIniKey a, MyIniKey b)
```

##### Parameters

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [MyIniKey](https://keensoftwarehouse.github.io/SpaceEngineersModAPI/api/VRage.Game.ModAPI.Ingame.Utilities.MyIniKey.html) | a   |     |
| [MyIniKey](https://keensoftwarehouse.github.io/SpaceEngineersModAPI/api/VRage.Game.ModAPI.Ingame.Utilities.MyIniKey.html) | b   |     |

##### Returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| System.Boolean |     |

#### Inequality(MyIniKey, MyIniKey)

Checks the two given [MyIniKey](https://keensoftwarehouse.github.io/SpaceEngineersModAPI/api/VRage.Game.ModAPI.Ingame.Utilities.MyIniKey.html)s for inequality. Note that this is inequality in the sense of a configuration key, which means the comparison is implicitly case insensitive.

##### Declaration

```
public static bool operator !=(MyIniKey a, MyIniKey b)
```

##### Parameters

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [MyIniKey](https://keensoftwarehouse.github.io/SpaceEngineersModAPI/api/VRage.Game.ModAPI.Ingame.Utilities.MyIniKey.html) | a   |     |
| [MyIniKey](https://keensoftwarehouse.github.io/SpaceEngineersModAPI/api/VRage.Game.ModAPI.Ingame.Utilities.MyIniKey.html) | b   |     |

##### Returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| System.Boolean |     |
