## The Asteroid station is a damaged space station which can spawn if the "Random Encounters" option is enabled in your world. It can be found by following the "UKNW MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's HUD for 1s every minute, from a distance of ~25 km.

Inside are 3 dead space engineers and the structure contains bullet holes indicating a fight went down.

\[Note: The station seems to be entirely unsealed due to catastrophic damage to the main structure, even if you repair and fill in the gaps it appears the station/bedroom is unable to be pressurized\]

### Notable Features:

*   A escape pod that will close its door and activate its rockets. Due to the fact that it isn't built by the player, you need to break out or hack the door to escape \[Note: The escape pod has a refill station you can refill your needs at\]
*   A gravity generator on the lower floor
*   A bedroom with lots of furniture blocks including - Inset entertainment x1, inset aquarium x1, captains desk x1, kitchen x1, couch x1, shower x1, inset bed x2, bathroom x1

### Notable loot:

1.  Gravity generator x1
