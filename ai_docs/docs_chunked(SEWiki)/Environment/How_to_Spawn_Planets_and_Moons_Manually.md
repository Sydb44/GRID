Newly created [sanbox games from the Star System template](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game") include all default planets, while other custom games and scenarios may contain only a subset. When an update comes out, new planets are not retroactively added to your old game saves. In this case, players in singleplayer and server admins can add planets manually, if desired.

How to add planets to a game:

1.  (In a [Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") game: Press Alt+F10 and enable creative mode tools, then press Alt+F10 to close the Admin Screen again.)
2.  Copy the GPS of the planet from the table above.
3.  Press K, open the [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") tab in game, and click "New From Clipboard". Make sure it is visible on your HUD.
4.  Travel to the GPS location.
    *   Either open the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") and go to **Cycle Objects > GPS** (press **Next** a few times until you find the GPS, then click **Teleport Here**).
    *   Or press F8 to go into [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode"), use shift+mousewheel to increase your speed, and "fly" to the GPS.
5.  Press Shift+F10 to open the [Spawn menu](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spawn_Menu "Spawn Menu"), and select "Planets" from the drop-down.
    1.  Select the planet or moon to add. (Do not select the ones that say "tutorial" or "example" or "test".)
    2.  Select its size. Use the diameter value from the table above.
    3.  Click **Spawn** and click to paste it.
6.  Press Shift-F10 again to close the Spawn menu.
7.  (In a Survival game: Press Alt+F10 again and disable creative mode tools.)

A planet or moon in your game save doesn't have to be spawned in its standard position to „work“, you can just place planets where you like. (The coordinates would only matter if you have copied GPS locations of standard ore patches from another save and expect them to work in the new game.) If you want the planet in its default location, see [How to move planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/How_to_move_planets "How to move planets").

When you manually [spawn a planet in](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spawn_Menu "Spawn Menu"), and you also want the planet’s moon, you must spawn the moon in manually as well.
