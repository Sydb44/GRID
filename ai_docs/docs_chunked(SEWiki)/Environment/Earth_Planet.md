The Earthlike planet is the most diverse [planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") in Space Engineers and the easiest planet to start and survive on. Good sources of renewable power are primarily solar panels and secondarily wind turbines. The ambience music is usually calm.

From space, you recognize the planet by its green-white-orange color and its small grey [Moon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Moon "Moon").

## Terrain

On the surface you'll find blue ice lakes, green grassy planes, sandy-yellow deserts, white snowy polar regions and mountain tops, grey rocky mountains, and woodlands with dark green trees. Earthlike's terrain is highly varied and ranges from easy and difficult to traverse in a wheeled rover, depending on where you are.

## Atmosphere

The atmosphere is thick with a lot of clouds. It has a breathable atmosphere and has a high density of oxygen.

The weather is very varied, everything from fog, rain, thunderstorms in the moderate regions; snowstorms and fog in the polar regions; and sandstorm and dust storms in desert regions.

## Surface Coordinates along the planet's center

This table lists the surface GPS Coordinates along the 3 axis crossing the planet's center. For each coordinate, two elements are the same as the planet's center point (lies on the same axis), while the third element was found by actually surveying the planet in-game.

| Extent | GPS |
| --- | --- |
| \-X | GPS:EarthLike -X:-60274.5:0.5:0.5: |
| +X  | GPS:EarthLike +X:61095.2:0.5:0.5: |
| \-Y (North) | GPS:EarthLike -Y (North):0.5:-61996.8:0.5: |
| +Y (South) | GPS:EarthLike +Y (South):0.5:61798.7:0.5: |
| \-Z | GPS:EarthLike -Z:0.5:0.5:-60901.1: |
| +Z  | GPS:EarthLike +Z:0.5:0.5:60070.5: |

**Tip:** You can copy the entire table and use "New from clipboard" in the game's GPS window, then double-click each one to mark it non-temporary.

## Position and Distance

EarthLike Planet is located at the center of the standard star system. Distances to other planets can be found in the [distance between planets and moons section of the Planets page](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets#Distance_between_Planets_and_Moons "Planets").

## Spoilers

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

  
To find ores, look for greyish white patches in the sand and canyon floors. Grasslands and Tundra prove more difficult for finding ore veins, but you can switch off grass in the settings to see better.

Earthlike's final challenge for beginners is [planetary escape](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planetary_Entry/Exit "Planetary Entry/Exit") using hydrogen thrusters in 1.0g gravity.
