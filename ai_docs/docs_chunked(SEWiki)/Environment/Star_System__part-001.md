# Star System - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The game Space Engineers is set in a star system containing [planets and moons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") and [asteroids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid").

Note: There is also a specific [Sandbox Game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game") template called [Star System/Home System](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Star_System_Home_System "Star System Home System") which contains everything mentioned here. Other templates and scenarios may contain fewer planets.

This article is about properties of the game's star system contrasted with how it is in real life.

## The Sun

The name of the sun or star system in game is never mentioned.

The sun is a light source painted on the skybox and you can never reach it. As a simplification, the skybox rotates around the Earthlike planet in the center, which is in contrast to real life, where the planets rotate, and also orbit the sun Sol.

The sun moving instead of the planets rotating also means that the length of a day in game is the same on each planet (by default 2 hours, this can be configured in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings")).

## Star System Size

If you traveled from one side of the game world to the other, and you fly at in-game maximum speed of 115 m/s, it would take you 552 years (2 x 6.6 AU / 115 m/s)! For practical purposes, the game world feels "infinite", but technically, it has of course limits.

The radius of the star system on PC is 1,000,000,000 km[\[1\]](#cite_note-1), which equals to 6.6 AU (astronomical unit; 1 AU = 150,000,000 kilometres). For illustration, 6.6 AU is slightly more than the distance from the Sun to Jupiter in real life.

The game uses double-precision 64-bit floating point numbers, even though Havok, the physics engine, uses only 32-bit floating point numbers. For optimisation, the world in Space Engineers is split into independent clusters, wherein each object has its own coordinates relative to the cluster center, that Havoc can handle in 32-bit.

Common cluster sizes are 50-100km, the minimal cluster size is 20km. A clustering algorithm guarantees that no dynamic object is closer than 2km to a cluster border. Clustering is totally transparent to us players, it happens in the background and we wonâ€™t see any borders.

## How to Identify Planets in the star system

Looking through a [camera](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Camera "Camera"), you can distinguish [planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") in space by their colours and by whether you see a moon or not.

*   [Pertam](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pertam "Pertam") (small and reddish) and [Triton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Triton "Triton") (small and white) have no moons.
*   [Alien planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Alien_planet "Alien planet") and [Mars](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mars "Mars") are both reddish with moons, but Alien has a cyan atmosphere and cyan lakes.
*   [EarthLike Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EarthLike_Planet "EarthLike Planet") has a grey moon and a thick blue atmosphere and is noticeably green-yellow-white

When you are on a planet's surface, it's good to watch the sun over the course of a day, to align solar panels. The apparent path of the sun against the sky is called the ecliptic.

If you observe a low ecliptic close to the horizon, it means you are in one of the polar regions of the planet. A steep ecliptic with the sun straight above you means you are near the equator of the planet.

You may notice that many other planets lie on the same ecliptic plane, resulting in observable eclipses[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) and planetary transits[\[3\]](#cite_note-3).
