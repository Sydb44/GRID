# Alien planet - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Alien planet is a medium hard start location, being the most rugged terrestrial [Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") in the game. The ambience music is alien, mysterious, dangerous.

In space, you recognise this salmon and green coloured planet by its cyan atmosphere and its reddish moon [Titan](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Titan "Titan").

## Terrain

The wide variation of terrain can make the use of wheeled rovers frustrating. The topography varies from sandy desert planes, to forested tundra, to sheer rocky mountain cliffs, with only little snow. Most ground is in jelly-like shades of orange, apart from "grassy" areas that are either vibrant green or yellowish.

Most ice lakes here are salmon coloured, and on the poles, the ice lakes are cyan.

The flora is mostly trees with alien shapes, and there are rumours of dangerous fauna.

## Atmosphere

The atmosphere is noticeably cyan coloured. It contains little oxygen and is dense enough for renewable [wind power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wind_Turbine "Wind Turbine").

The [weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather") has been reported to be quite varied: There's fog, rain, thunderstorms; sometimes sand storms or dust storms; and in the rare cold areas, snowstorms. The planet's atmosphere is infamous for a sudden emergence of green fog that is toxic to humans and slowly drains the suit's life support.

## Statistics

*   Strong surface gravity of 1.1g
*   Max Gravity Altitude: 39,870 meters

*   Atmospheric density (sea level): 1.2 atm
*   Atmospheric height (sea level): 14.4km
*   Atmosphere with exotic clouds
*   Air is breathable but has only little oxygen
*   Temperature: Freezing

## Surface Coordinates along the planet's center

This table lists the surface GPS Coordinates along the 3 axis crossing the planet's center. For each coordinate, two elements are the same as the planet's center point (lies on the same axis), while the third element was found by actually surveying the planet in-game.

| Extent | GPS |
| --- | --- |
| \-X | GPS:Alien -X:70790.2:131072.5:5731072.5: |
| +X  | GPS:Alien +X:192167.2:131072.5:5731072.5: |
| \-Y (North) | GPS:Alien -Y (North):131072.5:69075.2:5731072.5: |
| +Y (South) | GPS:Alien +Y (South):131072.5:192870.7:5731072.5: |
| \-Z | GPS:Alien -Z:131072.5:131072.5:5670163.6: |
| +Z  | GPS:Alien +Z:131072.5:131072.5:5791142.5: |

**Tip:** You can copy the entire table and use "New from clipboard" in the game's GPS window, then double-click each one to mark it non-temporary.

## Position and Distance

Alien planet is located at the far edge of the standard star system as part of the Alien planet and [Titan](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Titan "Titan") planetary system. Distances to other planets can be found in the [distance between planets and moons section of the Planets page](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets#Distance_between_Planets_and_Moons "Planets").

## Spoilers

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

If you land in the warmer biomes, the planet may seem to lack ice. Without the easy gathering of fuel for the hydrogen thrusters needed to overcome the planet's higher gravity, escape from the Alien planet may seem an insurmountable task. Exploration will lead you to ice lakes in the cooler reaches.

If spiders are enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), the native brown and black [Hostile creatures](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sabiroids "Sabiroids") make base building and navigating the landscape a risky challenge.
