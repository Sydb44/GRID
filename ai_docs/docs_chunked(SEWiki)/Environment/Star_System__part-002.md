Looking through a [camera](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Camera "Camera"), you can distinguish [planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") in space by their colours and by whether you see a moon or not.

*   [Pertam](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pertam "Pertam") (small and reddish) and [Triton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Triton "Triton") (small and white) have no moons.
*   [Alien planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Alien_planet "Alien planet") and [Mars](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mars "Mars") are both reddish with moons, but Alien has a cyan atmosphere and cyan lakes.
*   [EarthLike Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EarthLike_Planet "EarthLike Planet") has a grey moon and a thick blue atmosphere and is noticeably green-yellow-white

When you are on a planet's surface, it's good to watch the sun over the course of a day, to align solar panels. The apparent path of the sun against the sky is called the ecliptic.

If you observe a low ecliptic close to the horizon, it means you are in one of the polar regions of the planet. A steep ecliptic with the sun straight above you means you are near the equator of the planet.

You may notice that many other planets lie on the same ecliptic plane, resulting in observable eclipses[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) and planetary transits[\[3\]](#cite_note-3).

## Star System Gravity

There are no planetary orbits in game. Planets, moons, asteroids, and stations are static and are not in any way affected by gravity.

[Gravity](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") in game affects only players, items, [Artificial Mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Mass "Artificial Mass") blocks, and mobile [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid"), such as spaceships and rovers.

If an [Admin](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") were to spawn in two planets very close to each other, so they are inside each other's gravitational fields, they would remain motionless and not collide with each other. Players and vehicles travelling between them would, however, experience strange gravitational phenomena, comparable to overlapping [artifical gravity](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator") fields.

Moons in game possess weaker [gravitational fields](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") than planets, only 0.25 g. Asteroids in game are smaller than moons and planets and have no perceivable gravity.

## Lore

The sandbox game doesn't explicitly state the name of the sun or its star system. Some planets are similar to Earth's solar system, while others are very different. We know from the scenarios that the blue faction is called [Sol Cooperative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative"), but that could also mean that they originated from Sol and are here to explore this (as of yet unnamed) star system.

For your own playthroughs, you can customise the game and rename and change the planets to be any star system you want to set your story in.
