# Moon - Official Space Engineers Wiki

This article is about the planetary body named Moon. For planetary bodies, see [Planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets"). For other moons, see [Europa](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Europa "Europa") and [Titan](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Titan "Titan").

**Moon** is a [planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") in Space Engineers. In the [Star System/Home System](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Star_System_Home_System "Star System Home System") scenarios, an instance of it can be found near the [EarthLike Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EarthLike_Planet "EarthLike Planet").

## Terrain

It's a small planetary body with countless steep craters, grey rocks, and grey regolith, and rarely ice.

The terrain is full of steep round craters and hillsides; paired with low gravity, navigating this terrain is hard for small rovers. For space ships however, landing and lift-off will be easy, no atmospheric trusters needed.

## Atmosphere

If you are tired of the other planets' storms and fogs, you will enjoy the weatherless, cloudless, airless quiet of the Moon.

It has no atmosphere so wind turbines won't work at all; use solar panels to gain renewable [energy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power"), or hydrogen engines. No opening the helmet here, be prepared to bring oxygen.

## Statistics

*   Diameter: typically 19km
*   Surface gravity of 0.25g
*   Max Altitude with Gravity: 2,678 meters
*   No atmosphere, no oxygen, no clouds
*   No flora, no fauna
*   No weather
*   Temperature: Freezing

Moon is standard for a moon, with **1.4%** of the moon's surface area containing mineral deposits.

In order of proportion, Moon has:

*   [Nickel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Nickel_Ore "Nickel Ore")
*   [Iron](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore")
*   [Silicon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Silicon_Ore "Silicon Ore")
*   [Ice](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice") in surface lakes near the poles and underground
*   [Magnesium](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnesium_Ore "Magnesium Ore")
*   [Platinum](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Platinum_Ore "Platinum Ore")
*   [Gold](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gold_Ore "Gold Ore")
*   [Cobalt](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cobalt_Ore "Cobalt Ore")
*   [Silver](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Silver_Ore "Silver Ore")

## Surface Coordinates along the moon's center

This table lists the surface GPS Coordinates along the 3 axis crossing the moon's center. For each coordinate, two elements are the same as the moon's center point (lies on the same axis), while the third element was found by actually surveying the moon in-game.

| Extent | GPS |
| --- | --- |
| \-X | GPS:Moon -X:6902:136384.5:-113615.5: |
| +X  | GPS:Moon +X:25751.1:136384.5:-113615.5: |
| \-Y (North) | GPS:Moon -Y (North):16384.5:126860.7:-113615.5: |
| +Y (South) | GPS:Moon +Y (South):16384.5:145876.7:-113615.5: |
| \-Z | GPS:Moon -Z:16384.5:136384.5:-123167.9: |
| +Z  | GPS:Moon +Z:16384.5:136384.5:-104162.9: |

**Tip:** You can copy the entire table and use "New from clipboard" in the game's GPS window, then double-click each one to mark it non-temporary.

## Position and Distance

Moon is located at the center of the standard star system as part of the [EarthLike Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EarthLike_Planet "EarthLike Planet") and Moon planetary system. Distances to other planets can be found in the [distance between planets and moons section of the Planets page](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets#Distance_between_Planets_and_Moons "Planets").

## Trivia

In real life, the Moon is Earth's only natural satellite of significant size. The gravitational effect that the Moon has on the Earth has enough pull to create tidal forces credited for the development of life on Earth. The Moon acts as both a sun light mirror at night, a seasonal water cycle engine, and an asteroid shield for the Earth.

The Moon in Space Engineers is actually modeled based on the real Earth's moon terrain, flipped north-south.

## Spoilers

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

When searching for [ore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ore "Ore") on the Moon, it is most advantageous to look for golden-yellow marked surface streaks usually found near mountains and crater rims. The easiest way to find [ice](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice") on the Moon is to visit its polar caps.
