Hosts (admins) of multiplayer worlds can enable **creative tools** for themselves and cut or copy and paste fully welded blueprints. This is good to know if a friend has lost a [grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") due to a glitch and you want to help restore it.

But sometimes when you restore a grid, you don't want to give players in Survival Mode expensive components just for free. In this case, you can choose to paste an _unwelded_ blueprint instead, and let them weld it up themselves.

This procedure assumes that you already have the blueprint (for example, by subscribing to it on the workshop or by aiming the crosshairs at it and pressing [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[B key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")).

1.  In survival mode, press [ALT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") and make sure your **creative tools** are disabled.
2.  Press [F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Blueprint](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") screen and double-[![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click the blueprint. Nothing visible happens, but it goes into your clipboard.
3.  Press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the Blueprint screen.
4.  Press [ALT+F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") and enable **creative tools**.
5.  Press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the Admin screen.
6.  Press [CTRL+V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to paste the unwelded blueprint.

Afterwards, disable creative tools again if desired.
