The  [![Icon Block Medical Room.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Medical_Room.png/21px-Icon_Block_Medical_Room.png?a9d978)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") Medical Room is a [block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block") in Space Engineers that recharges the [Space Engineer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer")'s [Life Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support") in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"). It also serves as respawn point and suit customisation station.

The **Corner Medical Room** is the [Decorative Pack 3](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack_3 "Decorative Pack 3") DLC variant of the same block. It has the same functionality and same recipe

For related blocks with similar functions, see also [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit") and [Cryo Chamber](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cryo_Chamber "Cryo Chamber"). For a similar decorative block, see [Medical Station](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Station "Medical Station").

## Usage

The block has two configurable [LCD Surfaces](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Surface_Options "LCD Surface Options") on the inner side at the health recharging station.

In a combat situation, Medical Rooms become a target for attackers, both as a relatively expensive piece of equipment to loot, and also to starve a ship or station of its reinforcements, or deny the enemy the ability to heal themselves or recharge energy.

### How to heal and recharge

Energy intensive activities, such as mining with a Hand Drill, constructing, and salvaging by Welder and Grinder in space, drains suit power quickly. Visit the Medical Room regularly to recharge your suit reservoirs, with or without health restoration. Players in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") use the Medical Room as [Life Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support") to recharge both suit energy and health.

Face the display panel on the inner terminal of the block and hold the USE key [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to recharge.

*   If the Medical Room is [conveyored](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") to sources of gas such as tanks, interacting with this terminal also refills your suit [oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") and [hydrogen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") reservoirs. It does not, however, refill _gas bottles_ carried in your inventory.
*   If the block is not conveyored to filled tanks, the Medical Room only recharges power and health.

The Medical Room heals five times faster than the Survival Kit.

### How to respawn

After [death](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death"), your Medical Rooms are available as possible respawn points on the spawn screen. The location is available for the player who constructed and owns the block, and for any other players of the [faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Faction "Faction") with which the block was shared and who have used the Medical Room before.

To control whether respawn points are listed as ready or not ready, see **Enable Autorespawn** in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

If your world has several Medical Rooms/Survival Kits/Cryo Chambers, it's a best practice to give each a **Spawn Name** on the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"). Naming your respawn points makes it easier for you to tell them apart.

### How to customize the space suit

The Medical Room is commonly used in the spawn room of [Multiplayer Scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") to allow participants to select team colours. The suit customisation functionality works in Survival Mode as well as Creative Mode (see trivia below).

1.  Go to the outside-facing portion of the medical room that looks like a booth, to the right of the recharge terminal.
2.  Face the booth and press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to enter.
3.  On the [Character Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Screen "Character Screen"), change your suit color and select a [skin](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Skins "Skins") for your space suits.

## Trivia

In [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"), players can use the Medical Room's [Character Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Screen "Character Screen") to turn their [Engineer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer") skin into various [spiders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sabiroids "Sabiroids") or a [wolf](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cyberhounds "Cyberhounds") skin.

*   Disguised engineers will still be attacked by wolf/spider NPCs (if they are enabled).
*   Disguised engineers cannot use the jetpack, switch to first-person view, strafe, close their helmets, use handheld weapons / tools.
*   Disguised engineers can interact with blocks, can stand in cockpits, push buttons, use their flashlight, use their suit antenna, and place blocks.
*   Disguised engineers cannot move in zero gravity, on the other hand, they don't die in the vacuum of space either.

If you switch the game back to Survival Mode, you turn back into an engineer.
