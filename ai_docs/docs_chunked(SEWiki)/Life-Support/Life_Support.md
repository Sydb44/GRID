# Life Support - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![Medkit-and-powerkit.jpg](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Medkit-and-powerkit.jpg/320px-Medkit-and-powerkit.jpg?a05125)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Medkit-and-powerkit.jpg)

Life Support for [Engineers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer") covers the availability of oxygen and power, and avoiding [death](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death") by environmental dangers such as hostiles, [weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather"), [hunger](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food"), or the vacuum of space. Monitor your health, nutrition, oxygen, and power levels in the bottom left of the [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD").

Life support is trivial to maintain on the [Earthlike Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Earth_Planet "Earth Planet"), and gets more involved as you venture into space and travel across other planetary bodies.

Staying alive gives you positive [Buffs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Buffs "Buffs") over time.

## The Space Suit

The Engineer’s suit provides life support as long as its supplied with [power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power") and [Oxygen Bottles](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Bottle "Oxygen Bottle") and the helmet is closed in space (toggle the visor using [J key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")).

On planets with an atmosphere and high pressure, you can leave the helmet open or closed, as the suit also automatically uses filtered oxygen from the environment. In atmospheres with low pressure, the player can survive with the helmet open but the suit cannot refill itself.

The suit refills itself by emptying the bottles in your inventory. The suit cannot refill the bottles, only an [O2/H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") and tanks can.

## Recharging the Space Suit

You have the following options to recharge the life support in your space suit:

By using consumable items:

[![Icon Item Oxygen Bottle.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/Icon_Item_Oxygen_Bottle.png?d2b25e)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Icon_Item_Oxygen_Bottle.png)

*   Carry [Oxygen Bottles](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Bottle "Oxygen Bottle") in your [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") - they provide several large oxygen recharges, but are voluminous to carry.
*   Activate [Medkits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medkit "Medkit") in your inventory - heals you a little bit.
*   Activate [Powerkits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Powerkit "Powerkit") in your inventory - recharges suit power a little bit.

By using blocks:

*   Interact with a [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") screen - recharges suit fast if block is powered and conveyored to a source of oxygen.
*   Interact with a [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit") screen - recharges suit slowly if block is powered and conveyored to a source of oxygen
*   Enter a [Cryo Chamber](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cryo_Chamber "Cryo Chamber") - it keeps players inside alive as long as the block is powered and conveyored to a source of oxygen. But it provides no healing.
*   Add [O2/H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") to you base - it uses up  [![Icon Item Ice.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Ice.png/21px-Icon_Item_Ice.png?f8a728)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice") [Ice](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice") to recharge gas bottles placed in its inventory, and to supply gas to other blocks such as tanks/survival kit/etc.
*   Add [Oxygen Tanks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Tank "Oxygen Tank") - they quickly refill inserted oxygen bottles and provide a source of oxygen to other blocks.
*   Add [Oxygen Farms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Farm "Oxygen Farm") - provide a slow source of oxygen to other blocks when exposed to sunlight.

Interacting means aiming the crosshairs at the yellow-outlined interactive screen and holding [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") or pressing [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

*   [![Interact with the Survival Kit to heal and recharge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Survival_Kit_interact_to_heal.png/120px-Survival_Kit_interact_to_heal.png?f3ec6d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Survival_Kit_interact_to_heal.png "Interact with the Survival Kit to heal and recharge")

## Living in Airtight Cabins

To not constantly depend on these emergency recharging options on hostile planets or during a long space flight, sit your engineer in an [airtight](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") cabin.

*   The simplest cabin is a [Cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") block or [Fighter Cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Fighter_Cockpit "Fighter Cockpit") block that’s powered and conveyored to a source of oxygen.
*   Or you can build an airtight interior on your ship using pressurising [Air Vents](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Air_Vent "Air Vent") conveyored to a source of oxygen.

An airtight room or cockpit additionally protects you from environmental effects that drain your suit’s power, such as extreme [weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather") on planets, and vacuum in space and on atmosphere-free moons.

Refuelling the [jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") with [Hydrogen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") is similarly important for survival to get out of mining holes or return to the ship in zero gravity. And for an interior to be truly walkable in zero gravity (not just using [Magnetic Boots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Boots "Magnetic Boots")), consider building a [Gravity Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator"). Both of these pieces of advice are about manoeuvrability and not life support per se.
