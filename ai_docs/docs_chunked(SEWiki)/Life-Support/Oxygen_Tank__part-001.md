This block, although not mandatory for [survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support"), is immensely useful as a reservoir for [Oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") and to refill [Oxygen Bottles](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Bottle "Oxygen Bottle"). You also use it as one of the building blocks when building [pressurised](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") living quarters.

## Usage

The oxygen tank allows storage of gas and controlled transfer to airlocks and around stations quickly, preventing waste. In comparison, [O2/H2 Generators](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") would need to constantly melt ice to provide oxygen for the Engineer; an O2/H2 Generator has the disadvantage that it will attempt to fill all reachable tanks, even if the oxygen tanks are already full and it wastes ice to fill the hydrogen tanks. [Oxygen Farms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Farm "Oxygen Farm"), in contrast, waste no ice (they need only power and sunlight) to fill an oxygen tank, but they are much slower.

### How to fill oxygen bottles

Insert empty or partially empty [Oxygen Bottles](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Bottle "Oxygen Bottle") into the tank's inventory, then click the **Refill Bottles** button in the tank's [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") to refill them. The button is disabled when there are no Oxygen Bottles in its inventory or if they are already full. Alternatively, enable the **Auto-Refill** button to fill Oxygen Bottles in its inventory without having to press a button.

### How pressurise living quarters

To build pressurised living quarters with airlocks, combine [Air Vents](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Air_Vent "Air Vent") with Oxygen Tanks. For construction details see the [Airtightness](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") page.

### How to empty and fill tanks

You control filling and emptying of tanks in the Control Panel Screen.

*   Enable **Stockpile** to have the tank pull available oxygen from the O2/H2 Generator or from other oxygen tanks. [Air Vents](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Air_Vent "Air Vent") and [Medical Rooms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room")' oxygen recharging will not work while all oxygen tanks are on Stockpile.
*   Disable **Stockpile** to allow Air Vents and Medical Rooms to use up oxygen from this tank, or to transfer oxygen out of this tank into a stockpiling tank.

A cracked or grinded tank slowly loses all its gas.

### How full is the tank?

The status lights appear one after the other for each 25% filled.

*   black - empty or below 25%
*   all red - no power or switched off
*   all blue - accepting oxygen, not providing (Stockpile On)
*   green - providing oxygen to air vent (Stockpile Off)

All of the oxygen tanks can each hold up to 7 oxygen bottles.  
The small grid's Small Oxygen Tank, only having small ports, cannot pass bottles through it's conveyor ports. The only way to insert bottles in it's inventory is by manually interacting with one of the ports.

## Damage

Since update 1.200, when Oxygen Tanks are grinded down and damaged below the red line, they slowly leak oxygen.

## Construction

The Oxygen Tank requires power and must be connected to the [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") to be of use.

The small grid version has two small conveyor ports together on one side, and a large conveyor port on the opposing side. Its dimensions are 3x3x3 (Length x Width x Height). If you can make its shape fit, it is one of the few blocks that can transition the small and large [conveyor systems](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") on small grids.

The large grid block is 1x1x2 (Length x Width x Height). It has two large conveyor doors on the opposing ends. The large grid variant has a power draw of 1kw to provide oxygen to vents etc.
