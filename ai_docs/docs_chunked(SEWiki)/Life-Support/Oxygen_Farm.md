An Oxygen Farm block contains hydroponic plants which convert light from the sun into oxygen.

## Usage

This block is a way for [players](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer") to obtain [oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") from sunlight without needing an [O2/H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") with  [![Icon Item Ice.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/9/9a/Icon_Item_Ice.png/21px-Icon_Item_Ice.png?f8a728)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice") [Ice](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice").

One Oxygen Farm produces, in perfect conditions, 0.03 liters per second. This is less than half of what a single engineer consumes (0.063 l/s), meaning that you need 2 Oxygen Farms working at maximum efficiency to barely support one player.  
Aim for 3 Oxygen Farms per engineer to be on the safe side.

While Oxygen Farms paired with Solar Panels allow complete resource-independence, and allow for players to survive indefinitely in finite worlds, they are tedious to build as an early-game source of oxygen, and are very slow in filling any large rooms.

### What affects output

Same rules as [Solar Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel"):

*   Requires line of sight towards the Sun and anything physical will disrupt that, including glass windows.
*   Angle of each side towards the Sun, they may look rounded but it still expects perfectly straight exposure.
*   Current [weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather") if on a planet, some will reduce the Sun's intensity which results in reduced output.

### How to tell oxygen production status

Similar to the [Solar Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel"), the Oxygen Farm has a four-bar indicator for its current effectiveness.

*   Green colored lights indicate that the device is exposed to sunlight and working. The more green lights are lit, the better its output is.
*   When the lights are red, the block is switched off or the grid is out of power.

## Power

The block needs power to keep the hydroponic cultures inside alive.  
Their required input is 20 kW, which means it's worth switching them off when the oxygen tanks are full, to save power.

## Trivia

In the game files, the Oxygen Farm's icon and models are called SolarHydroponics.

## Construction

Similar to the [Solar Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel"), the Oxygen Farm only functions when constructed in a place where it is exposed to sun light.

The Oxygen Farm is 1x1x3 large blocks in size and has mount points on five sides of the cubical end, and on the front face of the longer, cylindrical end. The Oxygen Farm requires a connection to the [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") to store the produced oxygen in [Oxygen Tanks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Tank "Oxygen Tank"). The block has only one conveyor [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") on the front face of the cubical end.
