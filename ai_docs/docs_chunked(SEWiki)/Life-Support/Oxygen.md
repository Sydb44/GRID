Oxygen is a gas that can be transported through both [large and small conveyors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"). Its primary use is to maintain a breathable atmosphere for the Engineer.

## Uses

Oxygen is used for [Life Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support") by the engineer's suit and to fill [airtight rooms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness").

## Creation

You obtain oxygen by supplying an [O2/H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") with  [![Icon Item Ice.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/9/9a/Icon_Item_Ice.png/21px-Icon_Item_Ice.png?f8a728)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice") [Ice](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice").

Secondarily, an [Oxygen Farm](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Farm "Oxygen Farm") produces small amounts of oxygen when powered and exposed to sunlight.

A third option is buying oxygen at [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"), either to refill your space suit reservoir or you select tanks on a docked ship as the target.

## Storage

You store oxygen in [Oxygen Tanks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Tank "Oxygen Tank") on ships and bases, [Oxygen Bottles](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Bottle "Oxygen Bottle"), and in your engineer's suit.
