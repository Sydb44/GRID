## Using and Installing Mods

## Plugins

**Plugins** are not officially supported by KeenSWH and cannot be found on the Steam Workshop nor Mod.io. Plugins could potentially harm your system, damage, corrupt, or delete data outside the game or even install secondary software. However, they consequently also allow for more access than normal mods do, which is why a community has formed around creating and using them.
