### Important flight crash warnings

Remember to switch back to the normal cockpit controls by pressing [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") again.

You know you cannot use your normal cockpit toolbar while in Ctrl-G Block Placement Mode. But you might try to do it nonetheless, out of a habit...

Forgetting to switch back will pose an obstacle when you want to configure or use the ship Toolbar, or even cause a crash because you suddenly cannot use familiar shortcuts while flying anymore:

*   You won’t be able to quickly activate magnetic landing gear, gyroscopes, secondary thrusters, or similar habitual toolbar actions to stabilise your flight.
*   Similarly, while building "in person" as the engineer, you are used to pressing [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to [select colors and armor skins](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color"). While seated in a cockpit, [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") now toggles [the cockpit’s parking shortcut](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls"), which could unlock your landing gear or connectors, and that’s not what you expect in that moment.

While building from a cockpit, remember to use the [\[ key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), [\] key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), [{ key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and [} key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") shortcuts instead to cycle through skins and colours, don't press [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

## How to place multiple blocks

When building as the engineer in Block Placement Mode in [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"), you can quickly place multiple welded blocks.

*   To quickly place a row of welded blocks, hold [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") while dragging the mouse.
*   To quickly place an area of welded blocks, hold both [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") while dragging the mouse.

In Survival mode, the same shortcuts are not available; use a [projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") instead to "place" multiple unwelded blocks in bulk.

## Troubleshooting

### Why can't I place this block here?

If you are facing issues when aiming the ghost previews and when clicking to place them, try this:

*   (Creative Mode only) [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") scroll to increase or decrease the view distance between your camera and the ghost preview.
    *   Move the preview (and yourself) very close and make sure you’re in **Free Placement Mode** to place decorative blocks at odd angles relative to the grid.
    *   Move the preview (and yourself) further away if you are placing something large, or if you are placing rows of blocks in Creative Mode.
*   Try pressing [R key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") (or press the same [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") slot number again) to toggle the selected block size between [Large Grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") and [Small Grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid") size. The largest small blocks and the smallest large blocks look confusingly similar, and you can't mix sizes directly. Some blocks exist only in one size and resist placement otherwise.
*   Consider pressing [V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to switch between first person and third person view to get a different angle.
*   Make sure the engineer is not standing in the spot that the block will take up, step a bit back, the reserved area may be wider than the visuals indicate (e.g. wind turbines).
*   Make sure that there is no [scrap](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scrap_Metal "Scrap Metal") or other small dropped items floating in that space, pick them all up before placing a block.
*   Are you placing blocks next to a [subgrid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid")? The moving blocks attached to a rotor, piston, or hinge may be in the way. (Beware of causing [Clang](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Clang "Clang").)
*   Each block type has its mount points; not all blocks attach to other blocks on all sides.
*   Is your [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") switched off and you are not seeing the error message, for example, saying you are out of components in your inventory?
*   When building onto existing grids, make sure the grid has not accidentally split, and no loosely floating, detached[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) blocks are subtly encroaching into the build space.
*   While flying with your [jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") on, you can rotate yourself sideways in mid“air” by pressing [E key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") or [Q key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and fly “upside down” to reach odd angles from below. Even in gravity.

### How do I make the block preview stop snapping to the wrong grids?

If the ghost previews do not align as you expect before placing blocks, remember to press [B key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to cycle through **Free / Local / Gravity-aligned** and choose the appropriate placement mode, as described above.
