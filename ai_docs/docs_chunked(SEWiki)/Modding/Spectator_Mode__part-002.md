## Spectator Controls

### Spectator Flashlight (L)

While in spectator mode, press [L key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to switch on or off your imaginary headlights. This will not toggle the engineer's lights.

### Match Speed (Shift-MMB)

While flying in free spectator mode, you can match the speed of any other grids or engineers by [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-clicking the target. If the speed-matched target is a ship that's using its jump drive, the spectator will also jump.

**Warning:** If you have ever clicked [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") by accident, and it locked on to a random moving grid, it may appear to you later as if your spectator cam was drifting for no reason.

Click [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") again in mid-air to reset Match Speed.

### Spectator Sprint (Shift)

Holding [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") while moving with the WASD keys temporarily increases the flight speed, similar to sprinting.

### Set Spectator Movement Speed (Shift-Scroll)

Scroll [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") to increase or decrease the movement speed of the spectator camera. The mnemonic is, Shift like Shpeed.

### Set Spectator Turning Speed (Ctrl-Scroll)

Scroll [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") to increase or decrease the mouse-look rotation speed to be able to normally look left and right.

### Teleport the Engineer (Ctrl-Space)

Press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[SPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to teleport your engineer (_and the grid the engineer is seated in!_) to the Spectator's location.

If the teleported engineer is seated in a grid (seated means, piloting a ship/rover, lying in a bed, sitting in a chair, cryo pod etc.), then the whole grid teleports as well. If there is not enough space in the target location, your grids will be destroyed.

1.  First verify whether the engineer is seated in a grid or not and whether that's intended.
2.  If you do not want to teleport the grid, press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to leave the seat.
3.  Press [F8 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and use the WASD keys and mouse to position the spectator camera in the target location.
4.  Press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[SPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to teleport the engineer here.
5.  Press [F6 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to control the engineer again.

To quickly teleport yourself to a planet, a grid, a player, or a GPS, use the **Entity** menu of the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen").

## Exit Spectator, Return Player Control (F6)

[F6 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") returns control and the point of view back to the engineer. This is the normal first person / third person view that you are used to while playing.

Related useful commands after leaving Spectator Mode:

*   Toggle First-person / Third-person view -- Press [V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")
*   Zoom in third-person view -- Scroll [ALT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")
*   Free Look -- Hold [ALT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and move the mouse

## Usage examples

Apart from teleportation, block placement, snd seeing through walls, here are more tips how to make the most of the Spectator Modes:

### Don't get lost

Spectator Mode can be a confusing perspective if a player presses the shortcut by accident. If you suddenly find yourself "as a ghost stuck in space" or "stuck underground", always try pressing F6 first, it may already return you back to your normal perspective.

### Get the big picture

Spectator Mode is useful to get the big picture while [creative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") building. For example, you want to change light settings, [projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") orientation, or hinge/rotor/piston settings in the control panel; at the same time, you want to watch the effects of your changes in the overall scene.

1.  Go to the [Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options") and set your UI background to transparent. This will let you see the whole scene and the control panel at the same time later.
2.  Either sit your engineer down in a cockpit, or position your engineer with crosshair focus on an interactive port of the grid (for example, an inventory access port) so that the port is highlighted.
3.  Press [F8 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to go into Spectator Mode and use the WASD keys and mouse to find a good viewing angle.
4.  Press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") any time to access that grid's control panel and change settings while seeing the effects.
