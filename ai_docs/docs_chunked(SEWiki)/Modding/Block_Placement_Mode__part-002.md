Before placing a block, you see a ghost preview. At this point, press [B key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle between free placement mode, local-grid alignment mode, and gravity-aligned block placement, before you rotate the block.

*   **Gravity alignment mode** means that blocks automatically snap along the implicit world grid, so that all blocks are aligned with one another and the top side of all blocks is level. Rotation in this mode is limited strictly to 90 degrees. This mode only works inside gravity fields (natural or artifical) and it is useful when building on uneven terrain on a planet.

*   **Local alignment mode** means that blocks snap to the existing voxel grid or the station grid that you are currently targeting, in or outside a gravity well, for example, in space.

*   **Free placement mode** means that you can rotate blocks gradually at any angle and place them without snapping to any neighbouring blocks.

**Tip:** In creative mode, scroll [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") for aiming the ghost preview closer or further away!

  
See below for details about the rotation shortcuts.

## How to place blocks while seated in a cockpit

Typically, you place blocks "by hand" as the engineer or by projector. With all other tools, you have the alternative of using handheld or ship-mounted tools. The ship-mounted tools (grinder block, projector, welder block) can all be controlled from a cockpit.

It is similarly possible to place blocks "by hand" while seated in a cockpit, and you don't even need to build a block tool. This feature exists only in [Experimental mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode") on PC.

Short version: Sit in a cockpit and press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle your toolbar in and out of **Block Placement Mode**!

### Best Practices for building from a cockpit

Prerequisites:

*   (pre 1.206) Make sure that [experimental mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode") is enabled in the [Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options") on the main screen.
*   Make sure you have the necessary [building materials](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Build_Planner "Build Planner") in the cockpit [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") and in conveyored cargo.

Start outside the cockpit:

1.  Outside, press [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and select a color and armour skin; then press [ESCAPE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the [color](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color") picker.
2.  Still outside, press a number key to hold any block from the [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") in your hand. (This is a workaround for a bug.)

Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to enter the cockpit:

1.  Lift off and position the ship (using WASD keys and toolbar actions), as usual.
2.  Switch to _first person_ cockpit view: Toggle with [V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") if needed.
3.  Press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").  
    A message informs you that "Free Placement Mode is activated". The toolbar changes from the ship’s toolbar to a building toolbar. Repeat the following steps:
    *   Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to assign blocks to [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") slots, then press [ESCAPE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the G menu, as usual.
    *   Press a number key to select a block from the toolbar, as usual.
    *   Cycle through placement modes and rotate the ghost preview, as usual.
    *   [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click to place the selected block, as usual.
4.  To leave Block Placement Mode and regain cockpit control, press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") again.

### Troubleshooting: Why can’t I place blocks from a Helm or from a drone?

A [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") or [Helm](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helm "Helm") do not count as cockpits in the Block Placement Mode context, because they don't have inventory space. If you need to place blocks while remote controlling a drone, look into using a [projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") instead.

### Important flight crash warnings

Remember to switch back to the normal cockpit controls by pressing [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") again.

You know you cannot use your normal cockpit toolbar while in Ctrl-G Block Placement Mode. But you might try to do it nonetheless, out of a habit...

Forgetting to switch back will pose an obstacle when you want to configure or use the ship Toolbar, or even cause a crash because you suddenly cannot use familiar shortcuts while flying anymore:

*   You won’t be able to quickly activate magnetic landing gear, gyroscopes, secondary thrusters, or similar habitual toolbar actions to stabilise your flight.
*   Similarly, while building "in person" as the engineer, you are used to pressing [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to [select colors and armor skins](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color"). While seated in a cockpit, [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") now toggles [the cockpit’s parking shortcut](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls"), which could unlock your landing gear or connectors, and that’s not what you expect in that moment.

While building from a cockpit, remember to use the [\[ key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), [\] key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), [{ key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and [} key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") shortcuts instead to cycle through skins and colours, don't press [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
