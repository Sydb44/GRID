# Spectator Mode - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Spectator mode is a way to move the camera without the physical limitations of the engineer character. This mode is very useful for server admins, video directors, and world builders who need "the big picture".

Spectator Mode can be enabled or disabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"). In multiplayer survival, it is typically disallowed by the admin.

## What can the Spectator do?

*   Spectator can move through solid objects and planets, and it can see in the dark.
*   You can control the speed of the Spectator camera from very fast to very slow.
*   If the engineer is seated in a grid, the Spectator can use the [grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid")'s [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") and [control panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").
*   If the engineer is _not_ seated, the Spectator can use the Engineer's toolbar (for example to switch tools or trigger [emotes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Emotes "Emotes")).
    *   If [creative tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") are enabled, the Spectator can place blocks from the engineer's toolbar anywhere.
*   Be careful when creating [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") waypoints: The game will save the coordinates of the _Engineer_, and _not_ of the Spectator!

## Enable Spectator Mode

For the shortcuts to work, Spectator Mode must be enabled for each world in its Advanced [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"). For scenarios or multiplayer worlds it is possible that the creator or host has chosen to switch it off for everyone.

If you have access to the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") (for example in singleplayer or because you are the admin/host) you can also quickly enable Spectator in-world: Press Alt-F10 to open the Admin Screen, select Admin Tools from the menu, and check "Enable Creative Mode Tools". These creative tools include the spectator mode.

## How to Enter Spectator Mode

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |Comparison of the different camera modes
| **Key** | **Camera Mode** | **WASD/Mouselook moves...** | **and the camera...** |
| [F6 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") | Player Control | ... the engineer | ... is in first or third person view. |
| [F7 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") | Locked/Delta Spectator | ... the engineer | ... follows the engineer at a fixed distance. |
| [F8 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") | Free Spectator | ... the camera | ... moves without the engineer, without physical limitations. |
| [F9 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") | Static Spectator | ... the engineer | ... does not move. |

### Enter Free Spectator (F8)

[F8 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") is useful for builders to quickly explore the scene when creating a scenario, or for Admins to peek inside grids or planets when solving problems.

In Free Spectator mode, the WASD keys and mouse move only the camera, while the engineer remains where they are.

### Enter Delta Spectator (F7)

[F7 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") is useful when recording a cinematic video scene where a camera follows a moving character while the player is still able to control the character. This Mode is known as Locked Spectator or Delta Spectator (delta being the maths symbol for distance).

1.  Press [F7 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
2.  Hold [ALT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and use WASD and the mouse to position the camera.
3.  Release [ALT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and use WASD and the mouse to move the character.

Now, the WASD keys and mouse move the engineer as usual, while the camera follows the engineer.

### Enter Static Spectator (F9)

[F9 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") is useful while recording a long shot of one location while still being able to control the character in third-person view. This mode is known as Static Spectator. You can also use it when recording a video or timelapse of some [automated construction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer") or [drone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drone "Drone"), where you want to avoid accidentally bumping the mouse.

1.  First press [F8 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to enter Free Spectator.
2.  Hold [ALT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), then use WASD and the mouse to position the camera into the desired point of view.
3.  To freeze the camera there, press [F9 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

In Static Spectator mode _without_ holding [ALT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), the WASD keys and mouse move the engineer as usual, while the Static Camera stays in one place.

## Spectator Controls

### Spectator Flashlight (L)

While in spectator mode, press [L key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to switch on or off your imaginary headlights. This will not toggle the engineer's lights.

### Match Speed (Shift-MMB)

While flying in free spectator mode, you can match the speed of any other grids or engineers by [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-clicking the target. If the speed-matched target is a ship that's using its jump drive, the spectator will also jump.

**Warning:** If you have ever clicked [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") by accident, and it locked on to a random moving grid, it may appear to you later as if your spectator cam was drifting for no reason.

Click [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") again in mid-air to reset Match Speed.
