### Don't get lost

Spectator Mode can be a confusing perspective if a player presses the shortcut by accident. If you suddenly find yourself "as a ghost stuck in space" or "stuck underground", always try pressing F6 first, it may already return you back to your normal perspective.

### Get the big picture

Spectator Mode is useful to get the big picture while [creative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") building. For example, you want to change light settings, [projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") orientation, or hinge/rotor/piston settings in the control panel; at the same time, you want to watch the effects of your changes in the overall scene.

1.  Go to the [Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options") and set your UI background to transparent. This will let you see the whole scene and the control panel at the same time later.
2.  Either sit your engineer down in a cockpit, or position your engineer with crosshair focus on an interactive port of the grid (for example, an inventory access port) so that the port is highlighted.
3.  Press [F8 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to go into Spectator Mode and use the WASD keys and mouse to find a good viewing angle.
4.  Press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") any time to access that grid's control panel and change settings while seeing the effects.

### Use advanced camera tools

Another use case of the Spectator cam is recording Machinima videos from different camera angles. For advanced video artists, there is also a [Spectator Tool](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Tool "Spectator Tool"), which is used as a "camera man", and a [Replay Tool](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Replay_Tool "Replay Tool"), which is used to manage "actors". They all work together.

### Remap F-keys if necessary

If any other software, for example your video recording tool, uses the same F-keys to start a recording as the F-keys that Space Engineers uses to switch Spectator Modes, remember you can assign different shortcuts (either in Space Engineers' [Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options") or in the recorder software).
