*   Try pressing [R key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") (or press the same [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") slot number again) to toggle the selected block size between [Large Grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") and [Small Grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid") size. The largest small blocks and the smallest large blocks look confusingly similar, and you can't mix sizes directly. Some blocks exist only in one size and resist placement otherwise.
*   Consider pressing [V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to switch between first person and third person view to get a different angle.
*   Make sure the engineer is not standing in the spot that the block will take up, step a bit back, the reserved area may be wider than the visuals indicate (e.g. wind turbines).
*   Make sure that there is no [scrap](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scrap_Metal "Scrap Metal") or other small dropped items floating in that space, pick them all up before placing a block.
*   Are you placing blocks next to a [subgrid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid")? The moving blocks attached to a rotor, piston, or hinge may be in the way. (Beware of causing [Clang](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Clang "Clang").)
*   Each block type has its mount points; not all blocks attach to other blocks on all sides.
*   Is your [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") switched off and you are not seeing the error message, for example, saying you are out of components in your inventory?
*   When building onto existing grids, make sure the grid has not accidentally split, and no loosely floating, detached[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) blocks are subtly encroaching into the build space.
*   While flying with your [jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") on, you can rotate yourself sideways in mid“air” by pressing [E key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") or [Q key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and fly “upside down” to reach odd angles from below. Even in gravity.

### How do I make the block preview stop snapping to the wrong grids?

If the ghost previews do not align as you expect before placing blocks, remember to press [B key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to cycle through **Free / Local / Gravity-aligned** and choose the appropriate placement mode, as described above.

### How do I make blocks stop “rotating away” when I place them?

The rotation of a block is not only important for aesthetics but also when aligning [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port"). If the ghost previews of blocks snap to the right block, but then rotate themselves into an unexpected orientation, press [T key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to reset **Auto Orientation Mode**.

This orientation mode can be helpful in specific cases, e.g. if you have to place a block quickly while jumping without jetpack fuel. But depending on your situation, the automatic orientation choice can also be counter-intuitive.

### I can’t remember all these 3D angles and shortcuts...

Go to **[Options>Game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options")** and enable **Show control hints**, or **Show rotation hints** to get visual hints while rotating blocks.

If you don't see any reminders while in block placement mode, even after enabling this option, press [TAB key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") once or twice to cycle the HUD modes until you see the shortcut hints in the Toolbar and in the top right corner.

The main thing to remember is that the rotation shortcuts on a full keyboard's Navigation key block are paired symmetrically. Just press any of them and undo a rotation "misstep" by pressing the opposing paired key, until you find the right axis.

## Notes

1.  [↑](#cite_ref-1 "Jump up") Floating detached blocks are hard to recognise. Detachment can happen accidentally when deleting neighbouring blocks, especially in [Symmetry mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") when you can't keep your eyes on all side-effects of a click. Since loose blocks are often wedged in between neighbouring blocks, they still look as if they were part of the grid; you only notice that you strangely cannot build next to or onto them. To identify loose blocks, use [multi-block painting](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color"), because detached blocks won't change color. Also, when you [jump](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive") the ship, detached blocks will be left behind.
