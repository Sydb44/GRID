# How to export a prefab 3D model

You can export your grids from the game and use them, for example, in a [Player-made Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player-made_Encounters "Player-made Encounters") mod or any other mod.

1.  Build your grid.
2.  Use the right-most default red as faction/highlight [color](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color").
3.  In singleplayer world, aim the crosshairs at the grid and press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[C key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to copy the grid to your clipboard.
4.  Press F11 and select “Export Clipboard to File”.  
    The grid is exported to %APPDATA%\\SpaceEngineers\\Export\\.
5.  Place this file in your mod, under Data\\Prefabs\\.

A second method is to find the grid in the Blueprints folder, make a copy, open the copy in a text editor, and search and replace the word Blueprint for Prefab, and save it as a new file in your mod folder, under Data\\Prefabs\\.
