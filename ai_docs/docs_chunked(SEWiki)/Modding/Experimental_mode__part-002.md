## Experimental Mode on Consoles

On Xbox and Playstation, the Experimental mode gives console players the possibility to opt into high-performance physics features, such as the “shared inertia tensor” feature of [Mechanical Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks"), or allowing an increased number of players per game, or allowing higher PCU counts.

For example on Xbox, start Space Engineers, go to **Options > Game**, tick **Experimental mode**, and accept the warning.

Consoles do not have access to some features that PC has under Experimental mode, such as:

*   Unsupported stations (stations must be supported by voxels)
*   Sub-grid damage (it's always off),
*   Block limits (limits are always on),
*   [wolves](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cyberhounds "Cyberhounds")/[spiders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sabiroids "Sabiroids") NPCs (they are always off),
*   Adaptive simulation quality (it's always on).
