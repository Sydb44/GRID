# Block Placement Mode - Official Space Engineers Wiki

When [building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building"), pressing number shortcuts [1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to [9 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to select blocks from your [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") puts you in **block placement mode**. In this mode, you see a ghost preview of the selected block and you can click to place the block in the world.

*   In Creative Mode, [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-clicking will place welded blocks.
*   In Survival mode [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-clicking will place unwelded blocks.

You can place blocks "in person" as the engineer — and even while seated in a cockpit.

To exit block placement mode, either press [0 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), or select a tool (weapon, welder, grinder, drill) from the Toolbar.

## How to place blocks as the engineer

1.  Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to configure your [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") and add blocks to it. Press [ESCAPE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
2.  Press a number key to select a block from your toolbar.  
    You have now entered **Block Placement Mode**.
3.  Align the block's ghost preview, [rotate](#how-to-rotate-blocks) it, and then [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click to place the block.

## How to rotate blocks

[![Rotation directions diagram](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/Rotation-hud-help.png?13cf26)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Rotation-hud-help.png)

Six rotations:  
nodding your head up/down (green),  
shaking your head left/right (red),  
tilting your head left/right (blue).

You can rotate blocks only _before_ you place them, while they still appear as ghost previews. To make changes after placing, you have to grind them down and replace them.

**Tip:** While rotating a functional block, keep an eye on the conveyor [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") (marked with yellow rectangles). Unless you’re building for decoration, you will need to keep the [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") accessible and connected.

The rotation keys are [INSERT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), [DELETE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), [HOME key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), [END key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), [PAGE UP key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), [PAGE DOWN key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Ignore what the literal labels on these keys say, "Page Up" and "Page Down" do _not_ rotate up and down. Instead, these six keys are used similarly to paired arrow keys:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |Mnemonics for blocks rotation
| Block Rotation | Keys | Example |
| to rotate left/right | Delete / Page Down | shaking your head |
| to rotate up/down | Home / End | nodding your head |
| to roll sideways | Insert / Page Up | tilting your head |

**Tip:** If you rotated in the wrong direction, press the paired key to undo the rotation.

**Tip:** You may have noticed the cube also has 3 sides skyblue and 3 sides red/green/blue. Those R/G/B sides represent block's orientation as right/up/back (+X/Y/Z).

## How to color and texture blocks

*   Press [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to define your [color](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color") palette and select an armor skin (texture). Close the palette with [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
*   While building, press the [\[ key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), [\] key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), [{ key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and [} key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") shortcuts to cycle through skins and colours before placing the block.
*   Use [![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") to paint an already placed block. For more info on shortcuts, see [Color](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color").

## How to align blocks

Before placing a block, you see a ghost preview. At this point, press [B key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle between free placement mode, local-grid alignment mode, and gravity-aligned block placement, before you rotate the block.

*   **Gravity alignment mode** means that blocks automatically snap along the implicit world grid, so that all blocks are aligned with one another and the top side of all blocks is level. Rotation in this mode is limited strictly to 90 degrees. This mode only works inside gravity fields (natural or artifical) and it is useful when building on uneven terrain on a planet.

*   **Local alignment mode** means that blocks snap to the existing voxel grid or the station grid that you are currently targeting, in or outside a gravity well, for example, in space.

*   **Free placement mode** means that you can rotate blocks gradually at any angle and place them without snapping to any neighbouring blocks.

**Tip:** In creative mode, scroll [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")\-[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") for aiming the ghost preview closer or further away!
