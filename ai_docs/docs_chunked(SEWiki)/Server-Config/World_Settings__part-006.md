#### Enable Bounty Contracts

A PvP gameplay option for [Multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer"): If Economy [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") are enabled, the NPCs are allowed to offer Bounty [Contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts") to reward players for killing players that have low standing with their NPC faction (due to unfulfilled contracts or piracy). Enabled by default.

### Misc

#### Max Offline Broadcast Distance

The maximim distance the [Broadcast Controller](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Broadcast_Controller "Broadcast Controller") transmits messages when its owner is offline. Values between 0m and 20 km. Default: 200m.

#### Enable Spectator Camera

[Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode") allows all players use the spectator camera features (F6-F8) which allows them to look anywhere and even teleport there (ctrl+space). Disabled by default in Survival Mode.

#### Enable Copy/Paste

This allows all players to copy a grid (ship, rover, station) and paste the copy into the world, or turn the clipboard into a [blueprint](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint"). If the copied blueprint contains modded blocks that you don't have installed, you cannot paste it. The copy can be given momentum as it is pasted into the world, drifting through space if unpowered. Enabled by default in [Creative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") mode, disabled in [Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") mode.

#### Show Player Names

If enabled, nearby players will have their names displayed as text above their heads.

#### Enable 3rd Person View

Controls whether pressing [V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") toggles the camera between 1st and 3rd person view. 3rd person view is advantageous when exploring and when controlling ships and rovers; enforcing 1st person view makes the game more challenging. Being able to switch is enabled by default.
