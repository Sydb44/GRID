The game has a cooldown time how quickly a player can respawn in [Drop Pods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pods "Drop Pods") after dying or after pressing [BACKSPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Originally, a cooldown of 5-15 mins was intended to discourage players to call in numerous drop pods as a cheap source of materials, but this is no longer needed since the previous drop pod now self-destructs when you call in a new one. Hence the cooldown is disabled by default. Here you could enable the cooldown again and set it to a fraction or a multiple of the default value.

#### Food Consumption Rate

This setting determines how fast engineers get hungry. You can choose from Slow (starving in ~2 game days without food), Moderate, or Fast. If you choose Disabled, all [Food](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food") mechanics are disabled.

#### Survival Buffs

[Survival Buffs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Buffs "Buffs") are optional benefits in Survival Mode that engineers automatically gain over time. Benefits affect stats such as speed and health and are lost when you respawn.

#### Reduced Stats on Respawn

Every time you have to respawn, your health, suit oxygen, suit jetpack fuel, nutrition, and life support energy are set to critically low levels (~20%), and you lose all [Buffs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Buffs "Buffs"). This is an optional survival challenge that is not recommended for beginners.

### Encounters and NPCs

#### Cargo ships

If enabled, [Pre-Built Ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Built_Ship "Pre-Built Ship") will occasionally spawn at the edge of the [Star System](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Star_System "Star System") and drift through the sector. These computer-controlled (NPC) ships can be captured and salvaged. Some of these ships are unarmed, but those with turrets will fire at hostile players and ships that come close. Enabled by default.

#### Enable drones

If you approach or attack enemy NPC stations, the [Pirate](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") faction will defend themselves by sending armed drones after you. Enabled by default. See also [How to trigger Pirate Encounters on any map](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/How_to_trigger_Pirate_Encounters_on_any_map "How to trigger Pirate Encounters on any map").

#### Enable Economy

In multiplayer as well as singleplayer, you will sometimes encounter [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"): These are initially [neutral](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") space stations and planetary bases owned by [NPC factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions") that offer [Stores](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") and [Contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts"). The same NPC factions also own the passing [cargo ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cargo_Ships "Cargo Ships"). Disabled by default.

Note that, once enabled, it will generate a few megabytes of data that gets stored in the world save file, which does not get removed if disabled afterwards.

#### Enable Random encounters

#### Enable wolves

If enabled, hostile [Wolves, also known as Cyberhounds](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cyberhounds "Cyberhounds") spawn on the Earthlike planet and randomly attack players. Enable them if you are using [Food Consumption](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food").

#### Enable spiders

If enabled, [Saberoids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Saberoids "Saberoids") spawn on the Alien planet, and rarely on Titan and Pertam, and randomly attack players. Enable them if you are using [Food Consumption](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food").

#### Enable unknown signals

Whether random [Unknown Signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unknown_Signals "Unknown Signals") will spawn a cargo drop on a parachute for players to loot. Enabled by default in Survival mode. Not available in Creative mode nor on consoles.

#### Animal NPC Limits

The host can choose any number of active NPCs between 16 and 512, but nothing higher then 64 is recommended. Default is 32. This setting was added with Update 1.200 (Warfare 2) as part of the process of improving the Animal NPC API. The only animals are [spiders (sabiroids)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sabiroids "Sabiroids") and [wolves (cyberhounds)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cyberhounds "Cyberhounds").

#### Global Encounters Cap

This slider controls the number of [Global Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Global_Encounters "Global Encounters") with the [The Factorum](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Factorum "The Factorum") faction that can happen simultaneously in your world. You can set it to 0, 1, or 2. The default is 1.

#### Random Encounter Density

**Random Encounters** must be enabled for this settings to apply. Here you set the amount of random space encounters you want to have: Lowest, Low, Normal, or High density. Normal density is the default.

### Combat and PvP

#### Enable Weapons

If enabled, [weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") and [explosives](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Explosives "Explosives") will function normally. If disabled, however, attempting to fire a weapon will instead display a warning message indicating that they do not work. Enabled by default. See also [Damage Mechanics](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics "Damage Mechanics").
