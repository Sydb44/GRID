#### Sound Mode

You can choose between Arcade and Realistic sounds. Arcade sounds are how sound is often depicted in science fiction (audible explosions in space), whereas Realistic sound is more muffled in vacuum and with the helmet closed.

#### Solar Radiation Intensity

Requires Radiation and Airtightness to be enabled. This challenge adds an environmental hazard for being exposed to direct sunlight. Certain planetary atmospheres, roofs, and pressurized closed rooms (including closed cockpits) protect you from solar radiation damage. You can choose to set this to Disabled, Light, Medium, or Heavy.

### Survival

#### Enable Auto-Healing

If enabled, engineers will automatically heal damage in [pressurized](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") environments at a slow rate. If disabled, they will need [Survival Kits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit"), [Medical Rooms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room"), or [Medkits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medkit "Medkit") to heal. Enabled by default.

#### Delete Respawn Ship

Whether the respawn ship will be deleted when the player leaves the server or spawns in another one. Enable this to discourage players from calling in multiple [Drop Pods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pod "Drop Pod") to salvage them for cheap materials. Disabled by default. Enabled on public Keen servers.

#### Enable Auto-Respawn

By default, [dead players](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death") automatically respawn at your (faction's) _nearest_ available [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") or [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit"). All other possible respawn points are listed on the respawn screen as "not ready". To be able to spawn at a different point, players would have to temporarily switch off the closest respawn points.

The official multiplayer servers enforce Auto-respawn.

If you disable this setting in your own game, respawning players can choose a respawn point from the list, which is practically a means of "fast-travel without inventory".

#### Enable jetpack

Enabled by default. If disabled, pressing [X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") does not allow engineers to fly with their [jetpacks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack"), which presents the player with an extra challenge, and can end up getting you stuck in zero gravity.

#### Enable Oxygen

Oxygen is used as a survival mechanic by the Engineer's space suits and by engineers in cockpits and [pressurised rooms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness"). This game mechanic is enabled by default.

#### Enable Airtightness

Oxygen is used as a survival mechanic when building [airtight rooms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness"). Airtightness is enabled by default.

#### Enable Progression

[Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") means that engineers have to unlock [blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blocks "Blocks") by building specific blocks from the progression tree first. Enabled by default. Progression can help new players focus on essentials; advanced players can choose to disable it.

#### Enable Respawn Ships

Enabled by default so engineers can respawn in a ship or in their suit after they get killed. If disabled, it becomes practically a permadeath game.

#### Enable Space Suit Respawn

Typically, you respawn at a Medical Room, a Survival Kit (in the respawn pod), or a Cryo Chamber. Enabling this option adds the option of respawning floating in space, which offers a special [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") challenge. Disabled by default.

#### Spawn With Tools

By default, characters always respawn with a low-level handheld grinder, welder, and drill. Disabling this option presents the player with an extra challenge, for example in a [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario").

#### Optimal spawn distance

(Only relevant for [multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") games:) When new players spawn in, you can choose whether you want their drop pods to come in close to existing players (minimum 1km), or further away (up to 25km). This value is measured in metres, the default is 16000 (16 km). Spawning closer makes more sense for PvE and meeting up, spawning further away makes more sense for PvP or competitive play.

#### Respawn ship cooldown

The game has a cooldown time how quickly a player can respawn in [Drop Pods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pods "Drop Pods") after dying or after pressing [BACKSPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Originally, a cooldown of 5-15 mins was intended to discourage players to call in numerous drop pods as a cheap source of materials, but this is no longer needed since the previous drop pod now self-destructs when you call in a new one. Hence the cooldown is disabled by default. Here you could enable the cooldown again and set it to a fraction or a multiple of the default value.

#### Food Consumption Rate

This setting determines how fast engineers get hungry. You can choose from Slow (starving in ~2 game days without food), Moderate, or Fast. If you choose Disabled, all [Food](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food") mechanics are disabled.

#### Survival Buffs

[Survival Buffs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Buffs "Buffs") are optional benefits in Survival Mode that engineers automatically gain over time. Benefits affect stats such as speed and health and are lost when you respawn.

#### Reduced Stats on Respawn

Every time you have to respawn, your health, suit oxygen, suit jetpack fuel, nutrition, and life support energy are set to critically low levels (~20%), and you lose all [Buffs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Buffs "Buffs"). This is an optional survival challenge that is not recommended for beginners.
