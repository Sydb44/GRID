# World Settings - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The **World Settings** are the set of game [options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options") that apply to each created world separately. Here you choose sandbox game rules, world generation rules, random events, and so on.

Tip: In pre-1.206 created game saves, consider (re)enabling [Experimental Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode").

The pre-2024 World Settings screen when creating a new game.

There are two ways how to access the World Settings screen:

*   New game:
    *   On the Main screen, click **New Game** and then select a category, such as Sandbox, then click **Customise**.
    *   When creating a new game is the only time you can set the **Scenario template** and **Asteroid amount** options.
*   Existing game save:
    *   On the Main screen, click **Load Game**, select an existing game from the list, and then click **Edit Settings**.
    *   **Scenario template** and **Asteroid amount** cannot be changed anymore.
    *   Before loading an old pre-1.206 save, enable [Share Inertia Tensor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Share_Inertia_Tensor "Share Inertia Tensor") and other subgrid [Experimental mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode") features, if you are using them!

## FAQ

### Q: Why can't I find this or that setting?

A: Certain settings, such as the Scenario template and "Asteroid amount", cannot be changed _after_ the game was created. If other settings are missing, look under Advanced > [Experimental Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode"); note that the Xbox and PlayStation consoles do not have access to all of the same features that PC has in Experimental Mode.

### Q: How do I edit the World Settings of a save that is not a [Sandbox Game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game")?

A: When creating a [new game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_game "New game"), you've chosen among various templates.

To edit a pre-configured Scenario or workshop world:

1.  Create or download the world.
2.  Open, save, and close the world.
3.  Click **Load Game**, open its folder.
4.  Select a game save inside and click **Edit**.

Note that even though you can technically edit most pre-configured scenarios, this comes at the risk of breaking its intended gameplay.

## Standard Settings

The Standard Settings are the minimum choices that you need to make to create a [new game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_game "New game") with otherwise default settings.

### Name and Description

The name of the world is what will display in the **Load World** and **Join World** screens. The description will be displayed when hovering the cursor over the world's name when joining a world. Choosing a meaningful name and description is important for attracting players to an online world, and for yourself to distinguish between several offline saves.

### Game Mode

The game mode determines how gameplay will function in the world. The player change choose one of two modes, Creative or Survival.

*   In [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"), the player can place fully-constructed blocks without using resources. Inventory size is unlimited for both the player and blocks with inventories. Reactors and thrusters need, but do not consume, fuel. Players do not take damage and do not consume suit energy, and so on. Great for beginners and builders.
*   In [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"), the player must manage resources such as power, materials, food consumption, and fuel, in order to survive and build. The player can take damage from the [environment](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Environment "Category:Environment") and must be mindful of its dangers.

### Online mode

This option determines who, if anyone, can join the world from the **Join screen** while the player has it loaded. There are four options to choose from:

*   Offline: Single-player. The game is run offline and "max players" option is disabled.  
    Note: Steam still requires an online connection for your Steam client to let you use mods and DLCs.
*   Private: Multiplayer. No one can see and join the game unless you invite them.
*   Friends: Multiplayer. Only the host's friends can see and join the game.
*   Public: Multiplayer. Anyone player can see and join the game. Likely attracts griefers.

### Max players

This option is only enabled when not playing in offline mode. It lets you set the maximum number of players allowed to be in the world at once. The host can choose to allow any number of players between 4 and practically 32, and theoretically 1024. Actual performance depends on the hostâ€™s hardware, internet bandwidth, and complexity of the loaded world.

### Auto-save

If enabled, the world will be periodically saved. To open a backup from the load screen, double-click the game save as if it were a directory, and select an auto-save.
