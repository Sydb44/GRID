    Creative games can also be open for multiplayer, but they are filtered out by default.
*   [Steam group whitelist](http://steamcommunity.com/actions/GroupCreate?snr=)
*   Min/max ping
*   Min/max number of [mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods")
*   Min/max number of players
*   Min/max view distance
*   Environment hostility (this means [Meteors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Meteor "Meteor"))
*   compatible version
*   Individual [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") such as production multipliers or inventory size
*   Steam/EOS filter toggle  
    Use the **Steam/E** toggle to choose between PC only (Steam), and crossplay (EOS) for both PC and consoles.

Example: If you have a lower-end PC, you might prefer servers with low ping, zero or few mods, and a lower view distance. If you are on console, you prefer EOS servers and the current release, not the latest PC patch version.

## How to return to favorite and recently visited servers

[![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click a server entry to add it to your **Favorites** tab. After you have joined a server it will also show up in the **History** tab.

Tip: If the server does not show up under History/Favorites, check whether you have unknowingly left a filter on (for example, EOS/Steam toggle, or required minimum ping). Lower the filters or click **Defaults** to reset these filters to standard values.

## What to do after joining a game

As a newly joined player, open the [Multiplayer Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer_Screen "Multiplayer Screen") to see who is online. The host can kick or promote players on this screen.

In Multiplayer games, you can:

*   [Trade with other players](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Trading "Player Trading") that you meet, or trade in your absence through a [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store"), or offer each other [contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts").
*   [Chat](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Chat "Chat") and use [Emotes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Emotes "Emotes") with other players.
*   Found or join player factions and declare war or peace on each other on the [Factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") screen.
*   Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to check your free/available [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU").
*   [Build](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") cool things!
    *   Only players who have bought the [DLC](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC "DLC") can place/build/repair DLC blocks (that includes blueprints).
    *   All players can _use_ DLC blocks after they were built and shared.

In crossplay games, your fellow players' platforms are indicated by icons: PC, PlayStation, or Xbox.

## How to log off safely

Before you log out or take a break in multiplayer, remember to visit a [Cryo Chamber](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cryo_Chamber "Cryo Chamber") to save your engineer’s inventory and keep them alive!

Lacking a cryo chamber, store your inventory in an owned cargo container and sit the engineer down in a cockpit (or sear/bed in a room) that is pressurised and powered.

Depending how the server is configured, Respawn [Drop Pods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pods "Drop Pods") are deleted after you log out. To keep them, rebuild Survival Kit and Battery on a grid that you own.

## How to pause safely

When you press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") in multiplayer, you are just afk ("away from keyboard"), an online game does not pause! The game keeps running and your engineer could be attacked or have a crash. After a while, your engineer will run out of oxygen or power and [die](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death"). When you die while afk and don't pick up your backpack, you will additionally lose your inventory. If you are afk longer it's better to fully log off safely.

## Is Space Engineers PvP or PvE?

Space Engineers is a sandbox game. Sandbox games do not prescribe or enforce whether they are to be played "player versus player" (PvP) or "player versus environment" (PvE). On public servers, be prepared for either.

Factions can declare war or peace on each other, but this influences only in which colour their antenna [signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal") appear and how AI controlled [turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") or [Automatons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automaton "Automaton") react to them. An enemy could choose to [wave](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Steam_Achievements "Steam Achievements") at you and let you go along your day -- just as any neutral or allied player could choose to shoot you. A sandbox game does not enforce one or the other.

Related tips:

*   Voxel changes on planets, such as mining holes, are visible[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) from far away, do not expect to conceal an underground base on public servers.
*   Make sure your respawn points are owned by your faction and your faction does not auto-accept everyone.
*   There used to be a bug[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) that kept (potentially enemy) players respawning too close to another player, so griefers could triangulate another player's position.
