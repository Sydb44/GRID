# Multiplayer - Official Space Engineers Wiki

All [Sandbox Games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game") support both singleplayer and multiplayer, and can be played in Creative Mode or Survival Mode. Several [Scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") are even specifically designed for multiplayer.

## Multiplayer Scenarios

In addition to all [Sandbox Games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game"), the following [Scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") are designed for multiplayer:

*   [Never Surrender Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Never_Surrender_Scenario "Never Surrender Scenario") - cooperative space battle
*   [Lost Colony Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lost_Colony_Scenario "Lost Colony Scenario") - exploration and story
*   [Frostbite Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Frostbite_Scenario "Frostbite Scenario") - exploration and cooperative drone battle
*   [Sparks of the Future Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sparks_of_the_Future_Scenario "Sparks of the Future Scenario") - exploration
*   [Uranium Heist Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Uranium_Heist_Scenario "Uranium Heist Scenario") - three-teams competitive shooter/challenge
*   [Space Standoff Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Standoff_Scenario "Space Standoff Scenario") - two-teams competitive space battle
*   [Scrap Race Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scrap_Race_Scenario "Scrap Race Scenario") - eight-player competitive car race

## Before you host a game

Before you open up a local game for multiplayer, check the [world settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"):

*   Consider whether you want to impose block limits or player limits to stabilize sim speed.
*   Decide on an optimal spawn distance. If you play PvE, you may want your friends close by. In PvP, you may prefer respectful distance.

Opening up a game for multiplayer means it will be a peer-to-peer networked game where one of the players is the host.

Pros

*   You don't have to rent a dedicated server.
*   Space Engineers uses Steam / PSplus / Xbox Game Pass Ultimate / Xbox Live Gold matchmaking so you don't have to set that up.

Cons:

*   While the host is offline or has closed the game, the game cannot be reached by your fellow players.
*   The game's performance directly depends on the host's performance and internet bandwidth.

## How to host a game

If you are to be the host:

1.  Go to the main screen.
2.  Click **Load Game**, and select the [local game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_Game "New Game") that you want to turn into a multiplayer game.
3.  Click [Edit Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").
4.  Under **Online Mode**, choose a Mode:
    *   **Private** - Only players knowing your IP address can join
    *   **Friends** - Uses Steam match making.
    *   **Public** - Anyone can join â€” Not recommended, will attract griefers.
    *   **Offline** - Singleplayer, select this option to switch multipayer off.

Alternatives: For longer running games, consider [Setting up a Dedicated Server](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Setting_up_a_Space_Engineers_Dedicated_Server "Setting up a Space Engineers Dedicated Server"). Then use a [Steam group whitelist](http://steamcommunity.com/actions/GroupCreate?snr=) to list friends that are allowed to join, and it will auto-block everyone else.

## How to join a game

If you are not the host, wait for the host to tell you the server is ready.

1.  Go to the Main Screen.
2.  Click **Join Game** to open the **Join Game** screen where available multiplayer games are listed:
    *   The **Servers** tab lists public dedicated server games. Search for "Keen" to find official vanilla servers for various regions.
        *   Click the **Steam/E** toggle to choose between games via either **Steam** (PC-only games using Steam accounts) or **EOS** (PC, PlayStation, and Xbox crossplay hosted by **Epic Online Services**).
        *   Select an entry and then click **Server Details** to view World Settings, mods, online players, and their uptime.
    *   The **Games** tab contains public player-hosted games in your geographic region.
    *   The **LAN** tab contains available local area network games (e.g. in your household).
    *   The **Friends** tab makes it easier to find games that your friends have joined.
    *   If you have been given the IP address of a private game, press the **Direct Connect** button to paste it in and connect to it.

If the world has [mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods") installed, it will automatically download all required mods when you join; the first time round, this can take a long while.

Tip: If you use Steam matchmaking, it's often possible to right-click the host in your Steam friends list to join them in game. You can also click a Steam friend to invite them.

## What do the icons mean?

*   Lock Symbol: Multiplayer games can be password protected and can use [Steam group whitelisting](http://steamcommunity.com/actions/GroupCreate?snr=).
*   Warning Symbol: If the hosted game uses [experimental mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode"), you must also enable experimental mode to be able to join.

(Somebody please add what this means for console players?)

## How to find the right kind of server

Use the **Advanced** button to **filter** by various criteria such as:

*   Game mode: Creative or Survival.  
    Creative games can also be open for multiplayer, but they are filtered out by default.
*   [Steam group whitelist](http://steamcommunity.com/actions/GroupCreate?snr=)
*   Min/max ping
*   Min/max number of [mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods")
*   Min/max number of players
*   Min/max view distance
*   Environment hostility (this means [Meteors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Meteor "Meteor"))
*   compatible version
*   Individual [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") such as production multipliers or inventory size
*   Steam/EOS filter toggle  
    Use the **Steam/E** toggle to choose between PC only (Steam), and crossplay (EOS) for both PC and consoles.

Example: If you have a lower-end PC, you might prefer servers with low ping, zero or few mods, and a lower view distance. If you are on console, you prefer EOS servers and the current release, not the latest PC patch version.
