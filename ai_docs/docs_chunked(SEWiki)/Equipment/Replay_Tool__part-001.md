# Replay Tool - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![Replay-tool.gif](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Replay-tool.gif/320px-Replay-tool.gif?daf1c6)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Replay-tool.gif)

The Replay Tool is an extension of [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode"). you can use it to record yourself — even several times in the same scene, walking to different places, and the tool will replay a combined scene which appears to have multiple players (inter)acting in it.

The tool is typically used in Singleplayer Creative Mode. Press [ALT-F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") and you’ll find the **Replay Tool** in the menu.

**Note:** The Replay Tool itself does not _record_ any video. It only replays your inputs. You have to use an external video screengrabber to record the clips, and a video editor to stitch the clips together.

## Usage

You can use this tool to create cinematic screenshots or video clips in _singleplayer_ that have _several_ actors in it.

Experienced users (machinima directors, streamers, multimedia artists, etc.) can combine the Replay Tool, [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode"), and the [Spectator Tool](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Tool "Spectator Tool") to control different "cameras" and "actors" to create complex animated scenes.

## What can and cannot be replayed?

The Replay Tool replays your WASD keyboard and mouse inputs, and the save file stores your grids and actors in their start positions. You can replay walking (running, jetpacking, crouching), gestures and [Emotes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Emotes "Emotes"), using a handheld or grid tool/weapon, and you can steer ships and rovers that you are sitting in. You can set up [Sensors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor"), [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block"), or [Programmable Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block") to trigger any block action.

You cannot replay button pushes, [remote control access](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Access_Screen "Remote Access Screen"), terminal interactions, nor clicking to open doors. Similarly, you can’t replay entering/leaving seats, nor entering/leaving cockpits[\[1\]](#cite_note-1). Placing blocks is not replayed, either.

The replay of the physics simulation is non-deterministic, that means, bumping into something will look slightly different in every replay.

## How to replay a "multi"player scene

### 1\. Plan the story

[![You can create storyboards quickly in tools like MS PowerPoint / Apple KeyNote / LibreOffice Impress!](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Replay-tool-storyboard-example.png/320px-Replay-tool-storyboard-example.png?a7717f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Replay-tool-storyboard-example.png)

You can create storyboards quickly in tools like MS PowerPoint / Apple Keynote / LibreOffice Impress!

A [storyboard](https://www.techsmith.com/blog/video-storyboard/) is a visual movie script. Basically you outline how you imagine each scene as a primitive comic with boxes, circles, arrows, and stick figures -- nobody but you will ever see the storyboard, so waste no time making it pretty! Jotting down a storyboard will make it much easier to keep track of your scenes.

Tip: The fewer moving parts/actors per segment, the easier it is to record.

To lay out a storyboard:

1.  Visualise a series of short (meaning 10-20 secs long) segments.
2.  Add notes to each scene:
    *   How many engineers? Which suit colours? Which handheld tools?
    *   Which spaceships or vehicles?
    *   What will be in the background? Which buildings, asteroids, planets? (Include GPS coordinates of the chosen location)
3.  Which actor/grid shall stand/sit where, when, doing what, moving where to?
4.  Will you have to set up [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block")/[Sensors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor") in the scene to substitute clicks?
5.  Seen from which camera angle? Note down where the camera shall be and which way it faces and whether it pans.

Example:

If one actor crashes a ship into a base and another actor runs towards the wreck, you must record the crash first for the wreck to be in position for the second actor. Depending on your story, the camera angle could be looking up from the ground, looking down out a window, or an aerial long shot from a surveillance satellite. -- Experiment and find out the best cinematic camera angle _before_ you start recording.

### 2\. Prepare Actors

IMPORTANT: Before you load your saved game, click **Edit**, go to Advanced World Settings, and disable **Autosave**.

1.  Load the save game.
2.  Press [ALT+F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and select **Replay Tool** from the menu.
3.  Click **Add Character**, then click **Change Character** to select it.
4.  Press **Change Skin** to select the character’s look.
5.  Press [ESCAPE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and move the actor in its start position (either standing or seated).
6.  Repeat this to add all actors and position them.

IMPORTANT: Press [SHIFT+F5 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to save the game now.

### 3\. Record each actor

1.  Press [ALT-F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and open the Replay Tool from the menu.
2.  Click **Change Character** to select an actor.
3.  Click **Record and Replay** and make the actor perform their role.
4.  When one actors's scene is recorded, press Escape.
5.  After the Replay Tool opens again, click **Reload World**.
6.  Repeat step 2-5 for each actor and play their scene.
7.  When you’re finished, press **Stop Recording**, and press Escape to close the window.
8.  Save the game!

You can now return to the [ALT+F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") Replay Tool and press **Replay** to watch the scene.
