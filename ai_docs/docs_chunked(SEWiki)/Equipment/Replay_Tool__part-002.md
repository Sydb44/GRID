### 3\. Record each actor

1.  Press [ALT-F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and open the Replay Tool from the menu.
2.  Click **Change Character** to select an actor.
3.  Click **Record and Replay** and make the actor perform their role.
4.  When one actors's scene is recorded, press Escape.
5.  After the Replay Tool opens again, click **Reload World**.
6.  Repeat step 2-5 for each actor and play their scene.
7.  When you’re finished, press **Stop Recording**, and press Escape to close the window.
8.  Save the game!

You can now return to the [ALT+F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") Replay Tool and press **Replay** to watch the scene.

### 4\. Replay the scene and record the video

1.  Load the saved game.
2.  Use [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode") (or even [Spectator Tool](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Tool "Spectator Tool")) to position the camera.
3.  Press Tab or H to adjust the HUD and signal visibility.
4.  Start recoding a video file.  
    E.g. in Windows 10, press [WINDOWS+ALT+R key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to use the built-in GameBar.
5.  Press [ALT+F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the Replay Tool, and press **Replay**.
6.  Pan the camera and record the scene as planned in your storyboard.  
    You _did_ write a storyboard, didn't you? :-P
7.  Stop recording and save the video.  
    E.g. in Windows 10, press [WINDOWS+ALT+R key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") again to stop recording.

## Best practices

*   Before recording the video, hide the [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") and [performance warnings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warning_Options "Warning Options").
*   Set the [Field of View](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options") to 40; it'll make it look more cinematic and less like a game.
*   Practice recording with short segments, one actor, one static camera, keep it simple.

Start with few actors and few camera angles until you have gotten the hang of it, to avoid frustration.

*   For multi-actor scenes, set the most common suit colour on the game's main screen, so you don't have to set it for every engineer in the Replay.
*   In each shot in your storyboard, plan for each actor to be either seated or standing. The Replay Tool does not handle standing up or sitting down.
*   Press F6 to quickly cycle control from one actor to the next while recording, if needed.

Make one save file copy per segment:

*   Open a copy of the previous save file, delete the previous replay in it, and reset the scene to an ideal starting point. Then record the next segment.
*   This way, you are in full control of the start of the scene in each segment, no matter if, in the end of the previous replay, "the block dropped" in the exact desired spot or not.  
    

Keep each segment short (10-20 secs) so you can concentrate on getting each shot right.

*   Number and name the save files and video clips (e.g. "005-ship-crash-close-up"). This way you will be able to identify them quickly if you need to re-record a clip.
*   Afterwards, piece the numbered recorded video clips and segments together in a video editor.

## Caveats

You can’t record yourself building, because the tool doesn’t replay blocks being placed.

Don’t plan on recording long, complex scenes with many actors.

*   For example, suit colour settings are sometimes lost when reloading and have to be reset for each engineer, which is tedious if you have many actors.

The Replay Tool is temperamental and buggy/incomplete. Replays of game physics simulations are non-deterministic, this means:

*   Physics interactions (such as collisions, falling blocks, vehicle crashes, driving a ground vehicle, etc.) randomly end up slightly different every replay.
*   You often have to record the same segment repeatedly and pick the most suitable variant.
*   The longer the replay recording, the more non-deterministic it gets.

Minimise the extra effort caused by these inconveniences, by following the best practice of breaking up your project into small segments.
