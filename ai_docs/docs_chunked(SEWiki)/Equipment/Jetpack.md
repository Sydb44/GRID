# Jetpack - Official Space Engineers Wiki

All [Space Engineers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer") have a Jetpack built into their suits. It is used for flying short distances without a spaceship. The Jetpack works in gravity as well as in zero gravity.

In low gravity, the jetpack is your only way to get back to the ship or station if you are outside with [Magnetic Boots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Boots "Magnetic Boots") and drift off, so make sure to keep it fueled.

Jetpack used to return to ship

Jetacks used when fending off attackers

## Usage

*   Press [X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle between Jetpack and [Magnetic Boots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Boots "Magnetic Boots").
*   Use standard WASD keys to fly.
*   Press [Q key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and [E key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to rotate (roll) the engineer left or right while flying with the jetpack.  
    Flying in a rolled position is handy inside and outside gravity to fit through doors or to reach the underside of blocks while building.

### How to coast using Inertial Dampers

The Engineer's suit has built-in [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers") for the jetpack that work just the same as for space ships.

*   Press [Z key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers") on/off.
*   Look at a moving ship or player and press [CTRL+Z key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to enable Relative Dampers and follow at the same speed.

When you accelerate and then switch off inertial dampers in zero gravity, you coast along at your original speed by inertia, without using up fuel. In gravity, however, you beginn to fall. To brake your velocity in zero gravity, switch the inertial dampers back on.

### How to refuel a jetpack

The Jetpack uses up [hydrogen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") stored in your suit reservoir while it is in use.  
In natural gravity the jetpack consumes around 25 times more fuel per-[_g_](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Glossary#G "Glossary").

*   Refill hydrogen by carrying a full  [![Icon Item Hydrogen Bottle.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Hydrogen_Bottle.png/21px-Icon_Item_Hydrogen_Bottle.png?ac0a2e)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Bottle "Hydrogen Bottle") [Hydrogen Bottle](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Bottle "Hydrogen Bottle") in your [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory").
*   If your [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit") or [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") is connected to a [Hydrogen Tank](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Tank "Hydrogen Tank") or [O2 H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator"), recharge hydrogen by interacting with these blocks’ screens.
*   Some [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") offer a hydrogen refill for a few space credits at the [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") interface.

### What happens when running out of fuel?

When your jetpack runs out of hydrogen fuel, you first get a warning before you lose control.

*   In zero gravity, the engineer will drift without control.
*   In gravity, the engineer will fall and likely die due to an uncontrolled impact with terminal velocity.

If you run out of suit _power_, but still have hydrogen, the jetpack keeps working.

## Stats

The jetpack has 6 independent thrusters.  
Using a single thruster (by pressing a single direction) will accelerate you by 21.44 m/s2.  
You can activate 3 thrusters at once to accelerate by 37.13 m/s2.
