6.  Press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the G-menu.

Usage example:

1.  Press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[9 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to select a toolbar.
2.  Press [1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to [9 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to trigger an action.
    *   If it's a increase/decrease action, each key press steps a value up and down by a small amount; the slot displays the current (rounded) value.
    *   If it's a toggle action, the assigned slot displays the status, such as locked/unlocked or on/off etc.
    *   If it's a [block weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons"), the assigned slot displays the remaining ammo.
    *   If it's a [block weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons")/[block tool](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Tools "Block Tools"), it is assigned to [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/1/11/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right").

### How to trigger several actions

From a cockpit toolbar, you can set up either an action for an individual block or a [block group](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Groups "Groups"). For example, engineers often create groups containing all braking thrusters, all batteries, all drills, all doors, to be able to toggle them all on or off in one step.

To trigger several actions for a mix of different block types, configure a [Timer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") and assign the Timer's Run action to a toolbar slot. For example, resetting airlocks involves both closing doors and switching on air vents -- configure a timer to do that.

## How to use primary/secondary tool functions

The easiest way is to toggle the tool on/off:

1.  Use the **All Blocks** filter to add a Block Tool/Block Weapon to the toolbar.
2.  Press the slot number to toggle the primary tool action on/off.

To enable primary and secondary functions of [Block Tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Tools "Block Tools") or [Block Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons"):

1.  Use the **Block Tools** or **Block Weapons** filter to add it to the toolbar.
2.  Press the slot number to activate/deactivate that tool/weapon for mouse button control.

## Trivia

Did you know?

*   You can trigger emotes while seated, but only the top half of the body will be animated.
*   [Sensors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor") and [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") etc. also use toolbar actions when you set them up.
*   You cannot add building blocks to your toolbar while seated in a cockpit. For details how to build from the cockpit, see [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode").

## Troubleshooting: Why Can't I Use This!?

There are several reasons why you possibly cannot select an item from the toolbar:

*   Engineers in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") can only configure handheld weapons/tools/consumables that they have in their [inventories](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"). For example, you can only assign and use a medkit slot if you have a [medkit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medkit "Medkit") on your person. If you have only a basic welder, you cannot assign an advanced welder. Unavailable items will be grayed out.

*   When progression is enabled, some available blocks are limited until you unlock them. Read about [Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") to find out how.

*   You can drag any block into a toolbar slot, but in Survival Mode, you can only _place_ the block if the engineer has the necessary base [components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component") in the [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory").

*   Lastly, some blocks are only available if you have bought the respective [DLC Packs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC "DLC").
