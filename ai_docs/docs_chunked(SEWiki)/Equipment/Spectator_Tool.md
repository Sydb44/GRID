# Spectator Tool - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The Spectator tool is an extension of [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode") that advanced players can use as "camera men" when recording cinematic game videos. Streamers, multimedia artists, machinima directors etc. can even combine the camera positioning features of the Spectator Tool with the actor management features of the [Replay Tool](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Replay_Tool "Replay Tool").

Open the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") by pressing [ALT-F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and find the Spectator Tool user interface in the menu. Using this tool expects that you understand how to use [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode"), so look at that first.

Note: Each player has only one camera, so if you want to record a long shot or timelapse, you cannot control the engineer character _in first person_ at the same time. You still need a second player account to log in and record its point of view. The Spectator Tool does not add additional cameras.

## How to Record Video?

This page is not about tools that _record_ game video or take screenshots, it's only about how to position the one camera that we have in Space Engineers. For actual recording, use third-party software of your choice, such as [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), NVIDIA ShadowPlay, or the [Windows Game Bar](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/friends-social-activity/share-socialize/record-game-clips-game-bar-windows-10).

Tip: Hide [on-screen warnings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warning_Options "Warning Options"), and consider hiding [signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal"), or even hiding the whole [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") before recording. For more best practices see [Replay Tool](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Replay_Tool "Replay Tool").

## How to prepare cameras for cinematic shots

In the ideal case, you have written a script or storyboard that describes the planned scene and camera positions needed.

1.  Press [F8 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and use [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode") to position your camera.
2.  Look at a target character/grid and press [NUMPAD\* key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to lock the camera to follow the target.  
    The screen now says "spectating X, follow mode" or similar.
3.  Press [CTRL+NUMPAD<NUMBER> key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to save the current camera position and target in this numbered slot.
4.  Press [CTRL+ASTERISK key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to exit the camera config mode. (?)

You can preconfigure 1 to 10 camera positions.

## How to Choose a camera mode

1.  Press [ALT+F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and open the Spectator Tool screen from the menu.
2.  View the list of saved camera positions assigned to [NUMPAD0 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to [NUMPAD9 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Note in your script which number you have assigned to which grid/character.
3.  Choose a Camera Mode for each camera:
    *   None
    *   Free
    *   Follow -- looks at the target and follows it.
    *   Orbit -- follows the target and lets you manually rotate the view around the target with the mouse.
4.  Optionally, set a Camera Smoothness between 0.0 - 1.0.

## How to Switch Cameras While Recording

After you have set up your cameras, use the configured shortcuts to switch between cameras during a recording!

*   Press [NUMPAD<NUMBER X> key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to switch to the camera in slot X.  
    (Works only in Free/Follow/Orbit mode.)
*   Press [NUMPAD+ key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") or [NUMPAD- key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to focus on next or previous player.
*   Press [NUMPAD/ key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to switch to next camera mode.  
    It cycles none->free->follow->orbit->none.
