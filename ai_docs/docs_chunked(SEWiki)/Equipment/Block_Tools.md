Block tools in space engineers are large versions of handheld tools that can be built onto ships and rovers.

## Usage Examples

*   Constructor ship with Welder and Grinder
*   Salvage ship with Grinder
*   Drill ship
*   Planetary mining vehicle
*   [mechanical](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") Welder [arms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Custom_Turret_Controller "Custom Turret Controller") in station hangars
*   [3D Printer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer")
*   Welder Wall - quick auto-repair for ships with self-projectors
*   Grinder Pit - quick recycling of wrecks
*   In battle scenarios, static welders are often placed on conveyors close to important blocks as an auto-repair feature.
*   Unconveyored hidden Welder and Grinder Blocks can be used as lethal player traps
*   To [make a station mobile](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen"):
    1.  The station needs a cockpit and must be powered.
    2.  Attach an unconveyored drill to the side/bottom of the station to dig itself out of the voxels.
    3.  Dismantle and rebuild the drill repeatedly to reach all voxels intersecting with blocks

Drones can activate block tools, but since there are no sensors to detect ores or blocks, you cannot automate aiming, so either a player needs to remote control the drone or you need [scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripts "Scripts").

## Usage

When configuring Block Tool in the [G-menu toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") of your cockpit, it makes a difference whether you use the entry from the **Block Tools** filter or from the **All Blocks** filter!

## Construction

You can build Block Tools on [large](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") and [small grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid").

Block Tools need to be connected to the [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") and cargo containers to function fully:

*   Drills push ores into containers
*   Grinders push components into containers
*   Welders pull components from containers

Typically, block tools are part of mobile grids. But you can also build them on immobile stations, typically at the business end of [mechanical arms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") to give them reach, or as part of a static welder wall / grinder pit or [3D Printer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer").
