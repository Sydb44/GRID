To repeat actions:

1.  Build and set up Timers as just described.
2.  To create the loop, make the last action of one timer block re-start _itself_.
3.  To end the loop, make another sensor or another timer's last action stop the first timer.

### Is this thing on?

The sensor has a status indicator light:

*   When the Sensor light is red, the Sensor is switched off or unpowered, and does not detect anything.
*   When the light is green, the sensor is powered and ready to detect something (if anything was configured).
*   When the light is blue, it is detecting something and it has triggered actions (if any were set up).

## Construction

If [progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is enabled, build any light first to unlock this block.

This block exists for large as well as small grid and is very cheap to build as soon as you have a Basic Assembler (or have looted detector components).

You are building the block right side up when it looks like a one-eyed face with a mouth below. The "eye" is facing in the front direction in terms of range setting. It also works fine in other orientations but then you have to rotate the directional labels in your head accordingly.

The block is visually small, but in large grid, you cannot build anything else in its 1x1x1 space.
