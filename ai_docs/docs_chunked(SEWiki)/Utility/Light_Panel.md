The Light Panel is a light source. You can only build it if you have purchased the [Warfare 2 Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warfare_2_Pack "Warfare 2 Pack") DLC.

## Usage

The Light Panel is an alternative decorative light source. It works well as ceiling decoration together with [passage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Passage "Passage") blocks and is designed with a flat profile for tight spaces. May also double as a disco dance floor!
