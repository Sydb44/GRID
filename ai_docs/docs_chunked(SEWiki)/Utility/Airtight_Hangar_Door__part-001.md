The **Airtight Hangar Door** is a telescopic [Large Grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid")\-only [block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block") that extends from its standard size of 1x1x1 block to 3x1x1 blocks. Once closed, it seals an enclosed [airtight](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") room that can be [pressurized using Air Vents](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Air_Vent "Air Vent").

The  [![Icon Block Warfare Hangar Door.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/79/Icon_Block_Warfare_Hangar_Door.png/21px-Icon_Block_Warfare_Hangar_Door.png?d77502)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warfare_Hangar_Door "Warfare Hangar Door") [Warfare Hangar Door](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warfare_Hangar_Door "Warfare Hangar Door") is a variant with same function, size, and recipe, but a more martial style. You can build it only if you have purchased the [Warfare 2 Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warfare_2_Pack "Warfare 2 Pack") DLC.

## Usage

The block's functionality and user interface are identical to the [Door](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Door "Door"), so see there. Airtight Hangar Doors take ten seconds to open or close.

Use this block, for example, when building doors that can let through objects larger than a walking engineer — typically [Small Grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid") ships.

*   Their advantage is that they count as the same grid as the main grid and do not have the typical [subgrid issues](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") of larger, custom-build mechanical doors.
*   Their limitation is that the smallest side of the passing object can be at most 4 large-grid blocks = 10 meters high. It can be wider and longer than 10 meters though.

**Tip:** In the main grid's [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"), select all Airtight Hangar Doors that belong to one hangar door and create a group for them. Then assign the group's Open and Close actions to your [Tool Bar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") or in a [Timer Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") to trigger them.

### Example Applications

*   You can place a single Airtight Hangar Door as protective cover over individual fixed weapons, small thrusters, windows, or hidden interior turrets.
*   Build a row of Airtight Hangar Doors to create large seamless doors of unlimited length and up to 10 metres height. The basic 1x1x3 arrangement allows for a maximum length of 5 meters per Airtight Hangar Door block. Two Airtight Hangar Doors put _opposite_ of each other yield a sealable 10 meter length door. A _series_ of such opposite pairs creates a 10 meters high door of any length.

### Alternatives

You can build _any size_ blast doors using various combinations of [blast door](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blast_Doors "Blast Doors") blocks and mechanical blocks such as [Pistons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Piston "Piston"), but the pistons form separate [subgrids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") which are, even once closed, not airtight. Which may be acceptable for certain large-grid hangars.

For larger craft, elaborate solutions have been produced to build a larger airtight door assembly. You can build folding doors of any size on [hinges](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hinge "Hinge") or on [rotors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rotor "Rotor"), that can seal the room using [Merge Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block"), if you build the edges out of [Blast Doors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blast_Doors "Blast Doors"). But the fact that you cannot merge a subgrid back onto its own main grid, and the task of finding the right rotor head dislocation for the seal, makes these builds a bit fiddly.
