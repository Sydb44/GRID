Blast Doors are structural blocks very similar in use to armor blocks, but more robust.

## Usage

Blast Doors, [Blast Door Edge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blast_Door_Edge "Blast Door Edge"), [Blast Door Corner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blast_Door_Corner "Blast Door Corner"), [Blast Door Corner Inverted](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blast_Door_Corner_Inverted "Blast Door Corner Inverted"), and [Mechanical Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") are often used together to form sliding or folding doors and ramps. What's unique about Blast Door blocks is that they are slightly smaller than a full block in width, allowing them to slide or rotate safely between neighbouring blocks. Blast Doors also do not deform after damage, which makes them good bumpers or shields.

## Construction

You can build Blast Doors on large and small grids.

Structural blocks are the supports that protect ships and buildings from collisions, impacts, and attacks. They provide you with walls, ceilings, floors, windows, and doors. Other types of blocks are [functional](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Functional "Category:Functional") or [decorative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Decorative "Category:Decorative").
