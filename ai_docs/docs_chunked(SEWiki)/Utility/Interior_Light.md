Interior Lights are light [blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block") used for indoor lighting and short-range lighting. For similar long-range headlights, see also [Spotlight](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spotlight "Spotlight").

## Usage

These are your typical interior lights and underchassis lights.

*   Advantages are their low construction cost and low performance impact, meaning they can be crafted in great numbers.
*   Disadvantages are their short radius, that they cast no natural shadows, and that their light bleeds through neighbouring walls.

On the other hand, you can purposefully use the bleed-though light to indirectly illuminate up rooms from "behind a wall" if the rooms are too full for a light block to fit in.

Here are some more usage examples for this block:

*   [How to build runway lights](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/How_to_build_runway_lights "How to build runway lights") — showcases the block's Blink functionality

### Color values and examples

For color values see [RGB values for various types of real-world lights](https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengineers/comments/3e0k38/rgb_values_for_various_types_of_realworld_lights/) ([Screenshots of light colors](https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengineers/comments/1gmtc9l/light_settings_taken_from_real_lights_original/)).

### Control Panel Screen

Like the [Spotlight](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spotlight "Spotlight"), you can optionally customize the Interior Light on its [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").

*   **Color (R, G, B)**: The RGB color value of the light. Use the sliders to pick a color.
*   **Radius**: How far the beam of light will reach. 1m to 20m
*   **Falloff**: How quickly the light dims exponentially as distance from the lens increases. 0 to 3 (1=linear, 2=quadratic, etc.)
*   **Intensity**: The brightness of the light as it leaves the lens. 0.5 to 10.0.
*   **Offset**: The distance of the light source relative to the model. 0.0m to 5.0m
*   **Blink Interval**: The amount of time in seconds it takes for one on/off cycle. 0sec to 30sec.
*   **Blink Length**: The percentage of the interval for which the light remains on. 0% to 100%.
*   **Blink Offset**: The percentage of the interval before the light turns on. 0% to 100%.

### Toolbar Controls

You can adjust the above properties in the a control seat's [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") or from an automation block (e.g. from a [Timer Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") or [Sensor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor").

*   Set Radius
*   Increase/Decrease Radius
*   Increase/Decrease Falloff
*   Increase/Decrease Intensity
*   Increase/Decrease Offset
*   Set Blink Interval
*   Increase/Decrease Blink Interval
*   Increase/Decrease Blink Length
*   Increase/Decrease Blink Offset
*   Set Color - Use the sliders to input an RGB color value

### Troubleshooting

If the lights look odd, check [Options > Graphics Options > Light Quality](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options").

## Construction

Interior Lights can be built on large and small grid. Note that these visually tiny blocks need a full 1x1x1 block of their grid size to be placed and do not allow you to place any other blocks in that space. Also, if placed on thin blocks, their backside may poke through.

In contrast to most blocks, Interior Lights are not stand-alone; that means they cannot be placed in mid-air and dropped, they can only exist attached to a block. If you grind off their block, they are ground off with it.
