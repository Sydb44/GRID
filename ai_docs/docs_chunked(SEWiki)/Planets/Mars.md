# Mars - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![Mars.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Mars.png/320px-Mars.png?5adc34)](https://www.maptoglobe.com/rkakPL1Cw)

Mars is a medium difficult [planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") to start on. The ambience music is sometimes calm and and sometimes mysterious or dangerous.

In space, you recognise this planet by its rusty red color and its small lightblue moon [Europa](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Europa "Europa") next to it.

## Terrain

This planet is a rocky desert with deep trenches and steep hills. The surface is mostly rocks and reddish soil. There's no ice lakes and only rarely you come across snowy mountains. The large vulcano Olympus Mons is Mars' best known landmark among engineers.

For power generation,  [![Icon Block Solar Panel.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Solar_Panel.png/21px-Icon_Block_Solar_Panel.png?ded806)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel") [Solar Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel") are better than wind turbines here. Even though ice is easily found, the ice patches are not voluminous enough to make great use of hydrogen engines for power, unless you happen find a rare snow capped hill.

## Atmosphere

An atmosphere exists but it is thin with very few clouds, so remember that parachutes won't help when landing on this planet, especially given the relatively strong gravity.

The atmosphere is not breathable because it has no oxygen.

The temperature is always freezing cold. The non-clear weather is mostly storms or dust storms, and in polar regions, fog and snowstorms.

## Statistics

*   Surface gravity of 0.9g
*   Max Gravity altitude: 39,311 meters
*   Diameter: 120 km
*   Atmospheric density (sea level): 1 atm
*   Atmospheric height (sea level): 14.4km
*   No flora or fauna
*   Very thin atmosphere, no oxygen

## Resources

Mars is overall mineral rich, with **4.1%** of the planet's surface area containing mineral deposits.

In order of proportion, Mars has:

*   [Ice](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice") in surface lakes and underground
*   [Silicon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Silicon_Ore "Silicon Ore")
*   [Magnesium](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnesium_Ore "Magnesium Ore")
*   [Iron](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore")
*   [Nickel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Nickel_Ore "Nickel Ore")
*   [Gold](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gold_Ore "Gold Ore")
*   [Silver](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Silver_Ore "Silver Ore")
*   [Cobalt](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cobalt_Ore "Cobalt Ore")

## Surface Coordinates along the planet's center

This table lists the surface GPS Coordinates along the 3 axis crossing the planet's center. For each coordinate, two elements are the same as the planet's center point (lies on the same axis), while the third element was found by actually surveying the planet in-game.

| Extent | GPS |
| --- | --- |
| \-X | GPS:Mars -X:969481.3:131072.5:1631072.5: |
| +X  | GPS:Mars +X:1094129.1:131072.5:1631072.5: |
| \-Y (North) | GPS:Mars -Y (North):1031072.5:67765.8:1631072.5: |
| +Y (South) | GPS:Mars +Y (South):1031072.5:192831.9:1631072.5: |
| \-Z | GPS:Mars -Z:1031072.5:131072.5:1569055.3: |
| +Z  | GPS:Mars +Z:1031072.5:131072.5:1694188.9: |

**Tip:** You can copy the entire table and use "New from clipboard" in the game's GPS window, then double-click each one to mark it non-temporary.

## Position and Distance

[![Se system mars distances.svg](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/Se_system_mars_distances.svg?97d38e)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Se_system_mars_distances.svg)

  
Mars is located near-center of the standard star system as part of the Mars and [Europa](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Europa "Europa") planetary system. Distances to other planets can be found in the [distance between planets and moons section of the Planets page](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets#Distance_between_Planets_and_Moons "Planets").
