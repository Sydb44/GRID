# Pertam - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Pertam is the eighth [planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") discovered in the Space Engineers’ star system. It was added with update 1.197, the Wasteland Update. This planet is a moderately hard starting planet (and easy if you start in the safety of the [Pertam Orbiter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game#Pertam_Orbiter "Sandbox Game")).

The planet is renowned for its illegal [Scrap Races](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scrap_Race_Scenario "Scrap Race Scenario"). The music ambience is alien, dangerous, and mysterious.

From space, you recognise this reddish planet because it has no moons, similar to its moonless icy sibling [Triton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Triton "Triton").

## Terrain

On Pertam, you find many steep mountains that are part of an iconic large canyon system spanning the equator of the planet. The rest are flat, sandy and rocky desert plains with trees and grass and rare oases.

A rover is ideal for traversing the wide plains on this planet, even though the extremer parts of Pertam's terrain will present challenges to rovers.

Pertam’s higher gravity makes it a challenge to launch or land basic atmospheric or hydrogen-based ship. Due to the complete lack of ice lakes, hydrogen-based ships are not ideal for this planet. But ice isn't entirely unavailable, it's just very rare.

## Atmosphere

Pertam has a barely life supporting atmosphere and unpleasant weather, and there are only few clouds. [Oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") levels in the atmosphere are sufficient for survival as long as you stay close to the planet's surface.

The temperature varies greatly from cold to inferno, and from hot to inferno during sandstorms. The most common non-clear [weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather") is dust storms and sand storms. The planet is infamous for its dangerous electric lightning storms.

For power generation, [Solar Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel") are good for higher elevations and [Wind Turbines](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wind_Turbine "Wind Turbine") are a good choice for lower elevations.

Pertam is overall mineral poor, with **0.3%** of the planet's surface area containing mineral deposits.

In order of proportion, Pertam has:

*   [Iron](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore")
*   [Nickel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Nickel_Ore "Nickel Ore")
*   [Silicon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Silicon_Ore "Silicon Ore")
*   [Cobalt](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cobalt_Ore "Cobalt Ore")
*   [Ice](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice") only in underground deposits
*   [Magnesium](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnesium_Ore "Magnesium Ore")
*   [Gold](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gold_Ore "Gold Ore")
*   [Silver](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Silver_Ore "Silver Ore")

## Surface Coordinates along the planet's center

This table lists the surface GPS Coordinates along the 3 axis crossing the planet's center. For each coordinate, two elements are the same as the planet's center point (lies on the same axis), while the third element was found by actually surveying the planet in-game.

| Extent | GPS |
| --- | --- |
| \-X | GPS:Pertam -X:-3997350.1:-32231.5:-767231.5: |
| +X  | GPS:Pertam +X:-3937055.5:-32231.5:-767231.5: |
| \-Y (North) | GPS:Pertam -Y (North):-3967231.5:-62272.3:-767231.5: |
| +Y (South) | GPS:Pertam +Y (South):-3967231.5:-2145:-767231.5: |
| \-Z | GPS:Pertam -Z:-3967231.5:-32231.5:-797193.1: |
| +Z  | GPS:Pertam +Z:-3967231.5:-32231.5:-736918.2: |

**Tip:** You can copy the entire table and use "New from clipboard" in the game's GPS window, then double-click each one to mark it non-temporary.

Pertam is located at the far edge of the standard star system. Distances to other planets can be found in the [distance between planets and moons section of the Planets page](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets#Distance_between_Planets_and_Moons "Planets").
