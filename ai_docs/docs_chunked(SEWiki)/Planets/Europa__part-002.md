## Trivia

The game Space Engineers has Europa orbiting Mars, but in reality, Europa is the name of a moon of the planet Jupiter.

## Spoilers

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

The difficulty with a Europa start is that even stone is hard to come by. Everything underground is beyond the range of the handdrill's ore detector.

If you start here, you will have more success jetpacking up to an asteroid to fill your [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit") with stone. You would need to search a long time to find stone in the ice, since it is not highlighted by the ore detector.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

Stone can sometimes be found at surface level on the side of craters or in thin veins underground. Rarely will you spot ores (including  [![Icon Item Platinum Ore.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/5/52/Icon_Item_Platinum_Ore.png/21px-Icon_Item_Platinum_Ore.png?587799)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Platinum_Ore "Platinum Ore") [Platinum Ore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Platinum_Ore "Platinum Ore")) from the surface, even ore boulders are rare.

If you arrive here later in the game equipped with a large-grid ore detector, finding ores becomes much easier.
