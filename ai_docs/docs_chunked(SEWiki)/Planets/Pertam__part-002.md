## Spoilers

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

If spiders are enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), Pertam's fauna is brown and black [spiders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sabiroids "Sabiroids"), but they are very rare.

Considering the thin atmosphere, be careful when attempting to fly at high altitudes in an atmospheric ship. Oxygen is denser in the planetâ€™s lower canyons and crevices, making the floors of canyons ideal for starter bases while ice is still too scarce for oxygen production.

There is a trick to finding ice on Pertam: You will find the rare ice deposits underneath the few oasis-like spots and in wet-sand-colored ice patches:

A Pertam oasis (hinting at ice below) has dark green grass, not savanna coloured grass
