# Category:Pre-Built Ship - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Countless **Pre-Built Ships** and rovers are built into the base game, preloaded in [New Games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_Game "New Game"), passing by in random [Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Encounters "Encounters"), or purchasable in [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"). These vessels provide PvE and exploration content.
