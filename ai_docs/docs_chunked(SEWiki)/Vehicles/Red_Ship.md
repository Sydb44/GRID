This large-grid ship is the main attraction of the [Quick Start](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Quick_Start "Quick Start")/[Red Ship v2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Ship_v2 "Red Ship v2") sandbox game.

You enter on the ground floor in the middle from the sides: Here is a small ship hangar with two gates. The hangar sports a connector in the floor. Visit the front end of the ground floor if you need life support: Here you find a medical room, cryo chamber, o2/h2 generator, and an assembler containing ingots. There is no Air Vent and hence no pressurised habitation area on this ship. The back of the ground floor holds the engine room with the jump drive and 6 small warfare reactors (containing 60 kg uranium). Stairs lead up to the back exit.

When walking up the staircase you pass the toilet and battery storage. On the top floor, you find the bridge: Two helms, one control seat, and behind it an airlock with doors to the upper side exits. An Action Relay can transmit a signal to open the foldable ramp on the [asteroid platform](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Platform "Red Platform").

## Inventory

The cargo contains everything you need for an advanture: Handheld weapons with ammo, tools, medkits, ice, and hydrogen/oxygen bottles.

For its defenses, it carries some auto cannon ammo, assault cannon ammo, gatling ammo boxes.
