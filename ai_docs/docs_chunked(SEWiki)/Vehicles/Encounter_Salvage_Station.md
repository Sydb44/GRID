The Salvage Station is derelict station which can spawn if the "random encounters" option is enabled in your world. It can be found by following the "SPRT MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's HUD for only one second every minute in a distance of ~25 km. It is one of the few [random encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters") that contains valuable loot.

Players should approach with great caution, as there are 3 Gatling turrets, 2 Interior Turrets guarding the Station.

The station is a spaceship salvage station operated by the space pirates, where they destroy the captured ships and salvage their components. Due to this, a decent amount of loot can be found in the station.

## Trivia

The station was originally built by Aragath, a Keen employee. It can be found on the Steam workshop [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=874468583). The Steam Workshop version of it is named R.U.S.T. Outpost, and it does not include the self-destruct warhead nor any of the furniture from the decorative DLC (as it was before the DLC came out). Early prototype screenshots can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642558599) and [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=641892859).

## Traps

There is one [Warhead](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warhead "Warhead") located in the lower section of the base, and the 3 minute timer is triggered by the sensor in the staircase to the Control room. The player has more than enough time to disarm it before heading up to the Control station. If detonated, the entire station will be unusable.
