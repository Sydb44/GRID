## Description

This wreck likely used to be a civilian space station with a pressurised living and working space inside. Judging by the small number of oxygen farms and low power production, it could support a crew of 1-2 persons. With no medical room or survival kit to be found in the wreck, all that's left today is one dismantled Cryo Chamber.

There is no reactor to be seen. On the bottom, on one side, it has 3 (possibly formerly 4) Oxygen Farms and on the other, 4 solar panels. Without any mining or repair equipment left behind, the purpose of the station is hard to guess. On the bottom outside, the station is equipped with two levels of docking ports: The upper level has 4 docking connectors, and the lower level has two connectors with two merge blocks each. This configuration suggests it may have been a midway station for ships to dock and refuel hydrogen and oxygen.

Surprisingly for a station, it has hydrogen thrusters. This shows that it has basic manoevering ability before anchoring in space, possibly for being dropped off by a mothership.
