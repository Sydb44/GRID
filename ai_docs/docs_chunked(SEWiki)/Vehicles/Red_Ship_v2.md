# Red Ship v2 - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Red Ship v2 is the Sandbox game option when you create a [New Game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_Game "New Game"). It was added in May 2024 as a [Quickstart](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Quickstart "Quickstart") option to showcase the latest blocks. For the historical evolution of this ship, see [Red Ship 2021](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content"). It is inspired by older maps such as Lone Survivor or Red Ship.

This map is recommended for beginners to explore and experiment. Here you can recharge your life support, try out various fighters and utility ships, do some welding and mining, use the [production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") facilities, trigger sensors, and push buttons of [Action Relays](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Action_Relay "Action Relay") and [Broadcast Controllers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Broadcast_Controller "Broadcast Controller").

There are no guided objectives, but also no traps. The only danger at the station is running out of life support, so make it your first priority to discover a place to recharge your suit. If venturing away from the station, there is a chance to encounter pirates.

## Content

You spawn with three hand tools ([Hand Drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hand_Drill "Hand Drill"), [Welder (Tool)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_\(Tool\) "Welder (Tool)"), [Grinder (Tool)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_\(Tool\) "Grinder (Tool)")), a rifle with ammo, and a rocket launcher with 3 rockets.

The showcase contains an asteroid platform, several ships, asteroids (one of them called BaseAsteroid), but no planets.

There are three large grids:

*   [Red Platform](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Platform "Red Platform")
*   [Red Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Ship "Red Ship")
*   [Blue Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blue_Ship "Blue Ship")

There are three small grid ships:

*   [Red Fighter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Fighter "Red Fighter") - on top of [Red Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Ship "Red Ship")
*   [Red Miner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Miner "Red Miner") - on the [Red Platform](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Platform "Red Platform")
*   [Blue Team Constructor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blue_Team_Constructor "Blue Team Constructor") - next to the [Blue Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blue_Ship "Blue Ship")

Note: You may encounter [Mayday signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") to explore in space, which can be neutral or hostile.

In contrast to other custom games, you find strategically placed floating items here, such as drinks on the table or tools in the mine. Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to pick them up.

## Trivia

Red Ship v2 is an updated variant of the legacy [Big Red](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Red "Big Red") ship that was used in older custom game templates.
