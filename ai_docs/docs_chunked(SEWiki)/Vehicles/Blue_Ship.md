You find this large-grid ship as part of the [Quick Start](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Quick_Start "Quick Start")/[Red Ship v2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Ship_v2 "Red Ship v2") sandbox game. It is floating in space near the asteroid platform.

On the stern's topside, there are two exit doors above two outside connectors. Inside the stern, downstairs, you find the survival kit, o2/h2 gen, and jump drive. There is no air vent and no pressurised living area.

The middle section sports a striking thin glass corridor connecting the front and back of ship. The bridge is in the front upstairs, and below in the front, there's a small ship hangar.

## Trivia

This blue ship is often used in trailers, shown torn in half by a ramming attack, to demonstrate the game's destruction mechanics. From an engineering point of view, the corridor is an unnecessary weak spot.
