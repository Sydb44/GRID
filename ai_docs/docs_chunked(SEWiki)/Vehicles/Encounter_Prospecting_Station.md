The Encounter Prospecting Station is one of the [Planetary Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planetary_Encounters "Planetary Encounters") that appears as a possibly neutral signal on your [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"). It is owned by a random [NPC faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions"). This neutral base only attacks you after you start grinding blocks.

## Description

Stairs lead up and around to a sliding door that is locked at your arrival. The top floor is an office with 3 desks at windows and a lot of cargo containers.

The bottom floor is a computer room with AI blocks and Event Controllers that control the defenses. A bed may contain a Datapad with [Lore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lore "Lore").
