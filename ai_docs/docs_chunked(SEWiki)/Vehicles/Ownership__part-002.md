*   give ownership to another player who is online
*   Only server admins can transfer blocks to "Nobody".

To quickly change the ownership of all your blocks in the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"), click one and press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[A key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to select all blocks; then use the ownership menu on the right side like normal.

When taking over an enemy or neutral ship for your faction, first transfer ownership to yourself, and _then_ share it with your faction. After you give ownership to another player, you cannot control that grid nor change its ownership anymore.

## How do I take ownership? (Hacking)

Taking block ownership from another player or NPC faction “illegally” is called [Hacking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking").

When taking over or salvaging a grid owned by an enemy faction (players or NPCs), remember to hack all its blocks and also [claim its PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Claim_NPC_Ship "Claim NPC Ship"). Without hacking, your AI turrets will attack the captured enemy ship and also you will be unable to open doors and cargo containers, nor use the cockpit to change thruster or gyro settings, etc.

## Can I use an enemy for target practice?

You can add a virtual enemy identity and assign a block or ship to them. Then your turrets will use it as target practice. This is not a visible NPC that walks arounds. See also [Target Dummy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Target_Dummy "Target Dummy").
