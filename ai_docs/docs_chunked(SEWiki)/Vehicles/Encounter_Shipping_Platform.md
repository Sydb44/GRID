# Encounter Shipping Platform - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The Shipping Platform is a compact large-grid base that is a possible [Planetary Encounter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planetary_Encounters "Planetary Encounters").

It detects approaching players sends a warning first. If you grind/damage blocks, it switches to defensive mode. It is owned by a randon NPC faction, so if you damage it, you lose standing with them.

## Description

This base is elevated; it has two floors and two exterior ladders to get up to balconies with backdoors.

The lower floor contains a room full of goods ready to be shipped.

The upper floor contains several small rooms, some with monitors and control desks, and one staff living area with bed, bathroom, cupboard, and kitchen. The upper floor has a frontdoor going out to a landing platform with connector for on and off loading.
