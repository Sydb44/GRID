# EasyStation - Official Space Engineers Wiki

EasyStation is the name of the pre-built ground station in the [legacy games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content") "Earth Planet", "Mars Planet", "Alien Planet", and "Moon Base". The difference to the current [Quick Start](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Quick_Start "Quick Start") game is that the EasyStation is on a planet and does not showcase all the latest blocks.

## Should I play these maps?

Beginner space engineers are encouraged to use the provided equipment to study game mechanics and learn how to build bases, vehicles, and ships themselves for future adventures. You can play these games in survival mode or creative mode.

There are no objectives, feel free to modify, expand, and redesign this base to your liking, and explore the surroundings.

## Overview

The EasyStation is part of a multi-part exploration scenario for new Engineers who want to learn the game mechanics at their own pace.

The station provides all equipment for immediate survival on planets, including ore deposits close to the surface.

*   [Earthlike](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EarthLike_Planet "EarthLike Planet") is the easiest location for survival.
*   [Mars](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mars "Mars") and [Moon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Moon "Moon") are intermediate difficulty.
*   [Alien planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Alien_planet "Alien planet") is the hardest for survival.

The same station is being used as EarthEasyStation, MarsEasyStation, MoonEasyStation, and AlienEasyStation. The three core rooms and the provided equipment are always the same, while the position of the auxiliary platforms (and number of airlocks) varies greatly.

## Survival equipment

The station has the essentials for survival in Space Engineers:  [![Icon Block Medical Room.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Medical_Room.png/21px-Icon_Block_Medical_Room.png?a9d978)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") and  [![Icon Block Cryo Chamber.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Cryo_Chamber.png/21px-Icon_Block_Cryo_Chamber.png?cc526a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cryo_Chamber "Cryo Chamber") [Cryo Chamber](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cryo_Chamber "Cryo Chamber")s, two  [![Icon Block Refinery.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Refinery.png/21px-Icon_Block_Refinery.png?a9b68a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery") [Refineries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery"),  [![Icon Block Solar Panel.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Solar_Panel.png/21px-Icon_Block_Solar_Panel.png?ded806)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel") [Solar Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel"), and seven  [![Icon Block Battery.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Battery.png/21px-Icon_Block_Battery.png?fc3f6b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery") [Batteries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery"). It does not contain any [Reactors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Reactor "Reactor"), so keep an eye on your power usage and expand power production as needed.

What makes this base ideal for beginners is that it is autonomous and very forgiving. It not only supplies the necessary equipment for planetary survival, production, and recycling, but also provides a decent defense (automated turrets and a fighter ship) against NPC pirates. Connectors allow quick offloading of inventories from trucks and spaceships. Explore your surroundings, the bases have an ore detector and antenna to guide you to the closest ore or ice fields.

The cargo is filled with oxygen and hydrogen bottles to refill your spacesuit, and there's samples of all components and some materials for you to use. Additionally, the base is well accessible on foot over ramps; this ease-of-access allows the Engineer to reach essential parts of the base even after running out of Hydrogen fuel in the [jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack").

Important: The doors of the airlocks do not close automatically. Be careful when opening airlocks when first starting off on planets with no breathable atmosphere, the rooms will depressurise (but can be repressurised from large oxygen tanks). On atmospherically inhospitable planets (Alien, Moon, and Mars), the center room acts as a safe airlock when you use the Button Panels.
