## Trivia

After the introduction of planets, the EasyStation maps [used to be](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content") the first set of sandbox games to start with (after the two tutorial scenarios). They had names like "Easy Start Earth", "Easy Start Mars", and "Easy Start Alien".

## Spoilers

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

The starter maps where this base is found in contain two [factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions"): The [SPRT Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates"), and the FSTC First Colonists. The player starts as a member of FSTC.

All EasyStations are located in drone range of a hostile pirate station. It is recommended to use the existing factory equipment to increase your defences (turrets) to prevent damage to the station. Pilot the [Deterrent mk.1](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Deterrent_mk.1 "Deterrent mk.1") fighter and disable the Pirate facilities to make them stop sending drones after you.

In the original scenario, SPRT drones used to make their first assault within three to six minutes of the game start.
