The Hermit Station is a derelict station which can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is enabled in your world. It can be found by following the "[SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's HUD for 1 sec every minute, from a distance of ~25 km.

## Description

This derelict base is found buried in an asteroid. Engineers should aproach with great caution, as the defense systems are still active.

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

## Spoilers

There are two solar powered Gatling mounts guarding the asteroid, and 4 interior turrets guarding the entrance and interior of the Hermit station.

## Trivia

According to the log found in the inner section of the station, the Hermit, Milton Brooks passed away over 14 years ago, due to old age and radiation sickness.

Exploring the station can make you feel as if the ghost of the Hermit is watching you. His body can be found underneath the habitation pod in the station's central cavern, with his helmet off and naught more than bones filling his suit.

## Loot

The two large cargo containers of the Hermit station contain ~12k stone. There is no other ingot or component found on the station, unless the player decides to salvage the whole station itself, or use it as an outpost/refueling station. There are multiple Decorative DLC blocks, which will not yield components when destroyed, unless the player has the DLC installed.
