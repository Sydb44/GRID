The **Business Shipment** is a lightly-built transport ship that spawns when the [Cargo Ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cargo_Ships "Cargo Ships") option is enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

It is characterized by an array of several solar panels on the front of the ship and comes loaded with a variety of refined materials and repair parts to loot. If the Business Shipment is approached too closely it will turn on its Antenna ("Emergency - requesting Assistance"), summoning drone reinforcements.
