The  [![Icon Block Control Station.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Control_Station.png/21px-Icon_Block_Control_Station.png?72bc2e)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Station "Control Station") Control Station is an open seat variant of the [Cockpit block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_block "Cockpit block") for [Large Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") only. This open cockpit seat looks nearly the same as the  [![Icon Block Flight Seat.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Flight_Seat.png/21px-Icon_Block_Flight_Seat.png?bcdf3c)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Flight_Seat "Flight Seat") [Flight Seat](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Flight_Seat "Flight Seat"), except that it has a larger screen. The screen is a [configurable LCD surface](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Surface_Options "LCD Surface Options"). Unlike other cockpits, your first-person view is blocked when using it; this makes it mostly useful deep inside a ship.

## Trivia

This block used to be called "Cockpit 2".

## Cockpit Control

A cockpit block is essential to steer spaceships or rovers, and can secondarily be used as control station for a stationary base. Its third function is providing [Life Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support") for the player.

The multiple variants of cockpits function the same, they only differ in proportions, mass, visibility, material cost, conveyor ports, and grid size.

### Control Panel Screen

You can allow or disallow yourself to use certain cockpit functions. For example, a straight-boring drill rig does not want to worry about drift caused by the pilot touching the mouse—so switch off manual gyro control. Or, if the wheels of a monorail tram are controlled by a timer block, you switch off manual wheel control.

*   **Control Thrusters** -- (For [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") with thrusters only) Whether the pilot's directional inputs activate thrusters.
*   **Control Wheels** -- (For wheeled grids only) Whether the pilot's directional inputs propel and turn wheels.
*   **Control Gyros** -- (For grids with gyroscopes only) Whether moving the mouse controls turning (pitch, roll, and yaw).
*   **Handbrake** -- (For wheeled vehicles only) Enables you to add the Handbrake action to the [Toolbar slot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") to brake quickly.
*   **Park** -- Whether pressing [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") unlocks/locks connectors and landing gears. See [Cockpit Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls") for how to configure this for your grid's blocks!
*   **Inertia Dampeners** -- (For grids with thrusters only) Whether pressing [Z key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") toggles assistive [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers").
*   **Show Horizon and Altitude** -- See details about "Altimeter and Attitude" below.
*   **Main Cockpit** -- If the grid has multiple cockpits, specify which is the main cockpit. The main cockpit can steer vehicles (even from turret view), configure [Jump Drives](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive") and initiate jumps. Non-main cockpits on the same grid cannot.
*   **Enable target locking** -- See [Target Locking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Target_Locking "Target Locking") to learn how to make turrets lock on to targets.
*   **Set Up Action** -- See details how to configure "Cockpit Alarms and Countermeasures" below.
*   **LCD Panel** -- See [LCD Surface Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Surface_Options "LCD Surface Options") for how to run scripts or display text or images on the built-in LCD panels of the cockpit. For example to display a preflight checklist.

### How to Use Cockpit Controls

To sit in a cockpit, face the cockpit and press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to enter.

*   To control functional blocks while seated in a ship or station, press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").
    *   If you build several cockpits on a grid, set one as the main cockpit here.
*   Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to assign important control panel actions to your [Tool Bar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar").
*   Press [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to (un)lock [Landing Gears](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") and [Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector"). To configure this behaviour, see [Cockpit Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls").
*   Press [Y key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to switch on/off all Batteries and [Reactors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Reactor "Reactor").
*   Press [L key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to switch on/off all [Spotlights](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spotlight "Spotlight").

Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") again to exit the cockpit.
