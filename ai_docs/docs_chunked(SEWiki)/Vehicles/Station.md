[![Sparks of the Future](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Sparks-of-the-future-space-station.png/300px-Sparks-of-the-future-space-station.png?170791)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Sparks-of-the-future-space-station.png)

Space Engineers [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") can be mobile [Small Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid"), mobile [Large Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid"), or Stations. **Stations** are stationary [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") made of large-grid [Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blocks "Blocks").

## Comparisons

*   **Stations** are made of large-grid [Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blocks "Blocks") 125 times larger than the volume of [Small Grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid") blocks. This does not mean that the mass and costs are increased by 125 times, since the blocks are hollow.
*   In contrast to small grids and mobile large grids, station blocks can intersect with voxels (asteroids, moons, or planets).
*   Stations are the only [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") that can benefit from [Safe Zones](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone").
*   Stations are the only large grids that _cannot_ use  [![Icon Block Jump Drive.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Jump_Drive.png/21px-Icon_Block_Jump_Drive.png?c39dc2)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive") [Jump Drives](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive"), [wheels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel "Wheel"), or [thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster "Thruster"). If such a mobility block is added to a station, it will be non-functional, regardless of power, and can only be decorative.
*   If you dig into voxels to build a station, the hollows are not part of the grid blueprint.
*   The mobile variant of stations are [Large Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid").
*   Small grids cannot be stations.

## Examples

Examples of stations include planetary surface bases, mining outposts, mountain or underground hideouts, moon bases, asteroid stations, space stations, or space elevators.

Example purposes of stations include crew quarters (airtight living spaces with life support, cryopods, medical rooms), stationary cranes, [3D Printers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer"), grinder pits, welder pits, refuelling stations, mining rigs, production factories, [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"), airfields, or stationary defense grids.

Stationary grid means the building cannot drive or fly away; a cargo crane or folding ramp etc. on the station can still move using mechanical blocks.

## Construction

To begin building a station, place a large [Armor Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Light_Armor_Block "Light Armor Block") so that it is embedded in voxel, such as intersecting with an [asteroid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid"), [a planet, or a moon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets").

Alternatively, if the **Unsupported Stations** option is enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") on PC, stations are immobile and unaffected by gravity even if they are not touching any asteroid, moon, or planet.

In this case,

1.  Build a large-grid ship.
2.  Use its thrusters to position it in mid-air or in space.
3.  Use the [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen") to turn it into a station.
4.  Optionally, grind off the thrusters.

If the **Unsupported Stations** option is disabled (default), stations that are not anchored by at least one block that's embedded into voxels float freely through space like [Large Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid"). Possibly, one day, they will crash into asteroids or the nearest planet surface.

Stations only use large-grid blocks. Note that some functional and decorative blocks are only available in large-grid size and some only in small-grid size. When attempting to add a new block to a large grid in [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode"), the large-grid version is automatically selected, if not, then press the same [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") slot number a second time.

If a block does not have a large-grid version, you can’t add it to the station grid. The only exception is [this workaround](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/How_to_connect_small_and_large_grid_blocks "How to connect small and large grid blocks").

## Tips

*   When copy/pasting a station using [Creative Tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") or [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"), the ghost preview will move along a raster aligned to the copied station. Use this automatic alignment to merge a pasted station onto a pre-existing station!
*   Stations can be converted back into mobile [Large Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") under certain conditions:
    1.  Add mobility blocks such as thrusters to the base.
    2.  Drill to free the station from voxels.
    3.  Go to the [Info Tab](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen").
    4.  Click the **Convert to Ship** button.
*   Conversely, mobile large ships can be temporarily or permanently merged with stations and become static, using [Merge Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block").
