The Encounter Abandoned Colony Ship can appear as a "Distress Signal" on your HUD. It's a crashed rusty (or icy) large-grid mothership that is still powered, but it is not a dangerous encounter. It contains a lot of valuable loot including ores and possibly a small amount of [Prototech](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech "Prototech").

## Spoilers

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

  
This crashed ship was a colony ship that has been abandoned. You can still see the outlines of the hull, the staircases, and the interior, though many blocks are missing or worn down by weather to be non-functional. Considering that the cargo containers are still partially filled, it's not clear whether there were any survivors -- you can find one dead engineer with a datapad that tells a [lore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lore "Lore") story.

This huge ship is not a good candidate to be claimed and reconstructed (although it is, of course, possible, as a challenge): A lot of blocks are missing and partially underground. All functional blocks and armor blocks would need to be rebuilt. Looting the containers and grinding it down for components may be more effective.
