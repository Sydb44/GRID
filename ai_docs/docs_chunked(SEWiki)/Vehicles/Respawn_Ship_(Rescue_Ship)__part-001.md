# Respawn Ship (Rescue Ship) - Official Space Engineers Wiki

**Obsolete!**  
This article is about something now **obsolete** that is no longer present in [Space Engineers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineers "Space Engineers"). The page stays on the Wiki for historic purposes.

The **Respawn Ship (Rescue Ship)** used to be a type of [Pre-Built Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Built_Ship "Pre-Built Ship") that the player spawned in when creating a new world using the old _Asteroids_ [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario"). It used to be known as Respawn Ship 1 in game. It was replaced by other [Drop Pods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pods "Drop Pods").

Players who died without a linked and powered [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") used to respawn in a Rescue Ship at a distant location in the system.

## Should I choose it?

When it spawns, the ship will have some damaged and deformed blocks making up its hull. The ship was a good starting point for new players as it contains all of the vital components for travel, refining, assembling and storage. It doesn't have much fuel, so the player will have to secure a supply of uranium quickly to survive.

It used to be possible to farm this ship for all the materials needed in Survival mode simply by powering down any Medical Rooms linked to the player, then committing suicide. Using this method, the player would have to do very little or no mining to progress in the game. However, this trick only worked if the "Delete respawn ship" [setting](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") was disabled.

This ship did not change much during Early Alpha. Beta has given it twelve small [Ion Thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ion_Thrusters "Ion Thrusters") (originally it had less), one  [![Icon Block O2 H2 Generator.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_O2_H2_Generator.png/21px-Icon_Block_O2_H2_Generator.png?60936f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") [Oxygen Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator"), and replaced its  [![Icon Block Door.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Door.png/21px-Icon_Block_Door.png?322094)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Door "Door") [Door](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Door "Door") with a Sliding Door.
