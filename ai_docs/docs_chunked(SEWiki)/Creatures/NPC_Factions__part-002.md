## How to find NPC ships and stations

To find and trigger an encounter:

*   Switch on your [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") to full visibility: Cycle modes by pressing [TAB key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
*   Enable full [Signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal") on your HUD: Cycle modes by pressing [H key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

If you are in a world with Economy enabled, your Drop Pod contains a datapad with coordinates of a trade outpost. Outposts sell datapads with more coordinates to explore.

If you are in a world with pirate bases or Encounters enabled, travel around a few minutes in a straight line, and you should see their signals highlighted in red on your HUD.

Tip: In singleplayer, and if you are Admin in multiplayer, you can use the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") to see a list of all active grids, including the ones from Economy and Encounters.

If you have installed an Encounters mod from the Workshop, there will be other conditions and custom chat commands to see the mod status â€” read the workshop page thoroughly.
