# NPC Factions - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Apart from [Sabiroids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sabiroids "Sabiroids") (SPID faction) and [Cyberhounds](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cyberhounds "Cyberhounds"), Space Engineers does not have any Non-Player Characters (NPCs). The only interactive spawns are flying computer-controlled battleships, defense [Drones](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drone "Drone"), and [encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Encounters "Encounters"). NPC ships are members of [factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") and factions can be friendly, neutral, or hostile to the player.

## NPC Factions in Lore

The implicit lore in [scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") mentions several NPC factions:

*   First Colonists (FSTC) -- default player faction
*   [Space Pirates (SPRT)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") (sometimes misread as SPAT) -- The default antagonist. Starts out hostile, but if you destroy too many trader ships, they'll ally with you and you will only be able to trade with SPRT.
*   [Results Oriented Sciences (ROS)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") -- red fleet
*   [Sol Cooperative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative") (SOL) -- blue fleet
*   [Independent Terran Workers (ITW)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Independent_Terran_Workers "Independent Terran Workers") -- yellow fleet
*   [Argonaut Industries (AGI)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Argonaut_Industries "Argonaut Industries") -- green fleet
*   [The Factorum](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Factorum "The Factorum") (FCTM) - golden fleet. A permanently hostile faction that owns the [Global Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Global_Encounters "Global Encounters"). They are the creators of [Prototech](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech "Prototech").
*   [The Unknown](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Unknown "The Unknown") (UNKN) - The ownership of derelicts, wrecks, and other inert [encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Encounters "Encounters") is a permanently neutral virtual faction indicated as "unknown".

## NPC Factions in Economy trading outposts

When a world with [Economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") enabled is generated, a dozen random neutral NPC factions are also added. These factions own the [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") that the player comes across. The NPC factions are either miners, traders, builders, pirates, or military, in contrast to wrecks which are owned by [the Factorum](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Factorum "The Factorum") or Unknown factions. There are even certain sections of the NPC Trading Outposts that are ostensibly only accessible for faction members.

After an NPC ship or Trading Outpost appears on your radar ([HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD")) in Survival Mode, you'll see a message saying you have "discovered" this faction and their name is now revealed in the list in the [Factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") tab in your [Terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal"). In Creative Mode, all faction names are visible from the start.

## Who are the NPC traders?

By finding their names in the table below, you can distinguish multiple types of NPCs:

*   Miners sell and buy ores and materials.
*   Traders sell and buy components.
*   Builders sell rovers and ships and buy components.
*   Military sell predominantly weapons and ammo
*   Pirates sell predominantly weapons and ammo

They all have a chance of additionally selling  [![Icon Item Zone Chip.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Zone_Chip.png/21px-Icon_Item_Zone_Chip.png?72a7b7)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Zone_Chip "Zone Chip") [Zone Chip](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Zone_Chip "Zone Chip")s every time their stock is rerolled.

Knowing their goods type is relevant if you want to trade specific items, so you can head for the outpost most likely to deal in that area of business.

The names and colours of the Economy factions are randomly generated, drawn from a list of terms that are stitched together to create unique phrases and four-letter faction tags. Examples of such random names are “Supreme Shipbuilding (SMSB)” or “Interstellar Technologies (ISTC)”, and so on.
