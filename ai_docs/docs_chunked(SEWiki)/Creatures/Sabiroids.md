# Sabiroids - Official Space Engineers Wiki

A Sabiroid or Saberoid is a car-sized sixlegged spider-like entity that is hostile to players and will always attack them.

They are enabled in [Star System](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Star_System "Star System") by default. You can choose to disable "Spiders" in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

## Lore

All sabiroids are in the NPC faction "SPID" (Space Spiders) and their leader is called The Great Tarantula.

Sabiroids have been recorded in various colors such as black, green, white, or brown. They are native to [Alien Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Alien_planet "Alien planet") and [Titan](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Titan "Titan"). Since the recent settlement of [Pertam](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pertam "Pertam"), rare sightings of the brown variant of these invasive pests have been reported there as well.

## Behaviour

They spawn out of well hidden sand tunnels, often in groups of three, and they are known to burrow into bases from underground. They can easily overwhelm a lone player if not prepared. You can shoot them with turrets or handheld weapons.

Upon being killed, they can drop some components which they have likely bitten off a wreck. Approach a dead spider and press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to loots its inventory.
