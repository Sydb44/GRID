Being a sandbox game, Space Engineers does not have any lore that players must subscribe to. You are free to [add/move/remove/rename planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/How_to_move_planets "How to move planets"), make up your own PvP roleplay[\[1\]](#cite_note-1), background story, or add trader or PvE NPC factions[\[2\]](#cite_note-2).

If you want to build on top of an existing lore, you can choose to accept the [NPC Faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions") characterisations and events presented in any of the included [scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario").
