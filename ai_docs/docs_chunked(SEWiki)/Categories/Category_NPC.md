# Category:NPC - Official Space Engineers Wiki

NPC stands for non-player character, a common name for a computer-controlled hostile antagonist, neutral mission giver, or friendly companion for the player character.

Apart from the common [drones](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drone "Drone") and rare Saberoids, Space Engineers does not make much use of NPCs. Missions are given out by [Contracts Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts_Block "Contracts Block") instead of an NPC. Consider [mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods") if you want more variety.
