The following blocks and skins are only available in game if you have purchased the [Space Engineers - Decorative Pack 3 DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2504720/Space_Engineers__Decorative_Pack_3/).

Note that despite being a DLC, it doesn't actually download anything as all of its content is included in the base game, just made inaccessible. This allows players without the DLC to still see blocks and armor skins from it if they play on multiplayer servers with players who do have it, and play on [downloaded worlds](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") that include those blocks.
