# Category:Decorative - Official Space Engineers Wiki

(#searchInput)

This category lists all decorative blocks. In contrast to functional blocks, decorative blocks are not needed to keep a space ship flying or a factory going. Their purpose is to make the space look more lived in and human; some of them provide light or have small inventories that are not part of the conveyor system.

Other types of blocks are [functional](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Functional "Category:Functional") or [structural](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Structural "Category:Structural").
