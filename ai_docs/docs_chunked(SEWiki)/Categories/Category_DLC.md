This page contains categories about purchaseable Packs with extra paid content, for example, decorative [blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Downloadable_Content_Blocks "Category:Downloadable Content Blocks"). You may also be interested in [DLC and Achievement Icons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC_and_Achievement_Icons "DLC and Achievement Icons").

Note that despite being called DLC, they don't actually download anything, as all of their content is included in the base game, just made inaccessible. This allows players without DLCs to still see these blocks and armor skins when they play on multiplayer servers with players who have the DLCs, and they can play workshop worlds that include these blocks, they just can't build them.
