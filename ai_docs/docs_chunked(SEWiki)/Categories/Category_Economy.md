# Category:Economy - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Economy is a major free feature added in Version 1.192.0. All players can enable Economy in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

Optionally, you can purchase a [Economy Deluxe Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy_Deluxe_Pack "Economy Deluxe Pack") DLC with skins and trade related blocks.

## Free Update

For all games, the Economy update added [player-to-player trading](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Trading "Player Trading"), [inter-faction reputation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions"), and a currency ([Space credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits")).

Building Economy blocks let players access (NPC-generated or player-made) [Contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts") and trade offers. The included buildable [Safe Zone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone") blocks protect player bases from PvP raids.

## NPC Economy Option

Additionally, enabling the "Economy" option in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") will make NPC-owned [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") encounters spawn in the world where NPCs offer [goods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") and [contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts"). The goods include rare uncraftable trade items such as [Medkit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medkit "Medkit"), [Powerkit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Powerkit "Powerkit"), [Clang Cola](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Clang_Cola "Clang Cola"), [Cosmic Coffee](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cosmic_Coffee "Cosmic Coffee"), and [Zone Chips](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Zone_Chip "Zone Chip"). Additionally, the NPC stations trade ores, materials, and components, they refuel gases, and sell [spaceships and vehicles](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Economy_Ship "Category:Economy Ship").

You can enjoy the Economy features in multiplayer and singleplayer games, but specifically player trading and player contracts obviously only make sense in [multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") worlds â€” NPCs will not come and accept player-offered contracts or trades in singleplayer.

Tip: Experienced players can combine Economy with a [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") challenge.
