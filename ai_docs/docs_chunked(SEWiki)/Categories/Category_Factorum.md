## Lore

> As the world shifted from the Military Industrial Complex to the Aerospace Industrial Complex, those who made their money in defense were at a crossroads.
> 
> Some adapted to the times. They turned their intercontinental missiles into space ships, their swords into plowshares. Some retired. They decided there were fates worse than watching your billions become millions.
> 
> But some fought against change, against Modularity. They fought unimpeded by morality, consequences be damned. They created a unique [Prototech](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech "Prototech").
> 
> And they call themselves The Factorum. [\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

## Trivia

The name could be inspired by the Latin base word for "making, creating", from which we get words such as "factory" or ["Factotum"](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/factotum) (jack-of-all-trades in Latin). Factorum in Latin means "of the ones who/that were made".

  
The name could also be simply "factory" + "forum", indicates their origin in the lore (A "regular forum" and a factory that researches [Prototech](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech "Prototech")) and their poor creativity for naming.
