# Space Engineers Wiki:Contributors - Official Space Engineers Wiki

You want to improve content or contribute a page to the Wiki? Thank you and welcome!

The goal of a Wiki is to make keeping websites up-to-date as easy as typing in a text editor, so everyone can contribute. Leave comments and questions in the **Discussions** tab or ask directly on the SE wiki channel on Keen's Discord.

The [Wiki FAQ](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wiki_FAQ "Wiki FAQ") answers the question which wiki is the official and most current one.

## How to Get Started

You can always _read_ pages without the need to register or log in. To be able to leave comments, edit or add pages, [register a wiki.gg account](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Special:CreateAccount).

### How to edit a page

1.  Log in to wiki.gg.
2.  Go to the SE wiki page.
3.  Click **Edit**. You can edit the page and write like in a simple text editor! Please stick to our [Style Guide](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineers_Wiki:Styling_Guide "Space Engineers Wiki:Styling Guide").
4.  Click **Preview**.
5.  Click **Save**.

See some formatting that is hard to decipher? Do you want to edit embedded InfoBoxes or NavBoxes? Don't worry, just leave a comment on the **Discussion** tab and an Admin can help you.

### How to add a new page

For example, let's say you want to add a page called Thruster Comparison.

1.  Log in.
2.  Find a _related_ page and edit it.  
    In this example, go to the Thrusters page.
3.  Add a line about your new page.  
    In this example, you could add: "To help you choose the best thrusters, use the Thruster Comparison."
4.  Surround the name of the new page with double square brackets!  
    In this example, "To help you choose the best thrusters, use the \[\[Thruster Comparison\]\]."
5.  Save your changes. Now the name of your future page is marked red.  
    In this example, you'll see "To help you choose the best thrusters, use the Thruster Comparison."
6.  Click the red link to create your new page!

This approach how to create wiki links ensures that each new page exists in a context and can be found by other readers.

## What are our tasks?

Since the official Space Engineers release in February 2019, the game content has become quite stable. In the recent years, Keen Software House has released several free updates and paid DLC each year and it is now easier for the community to keep this wiki up-to-date. If you find a mistake, click edit and fix it, or leave a comment, or contact an [administrator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Special:ListUsers/sysop "Special:ListUsers/sysop") -- we can help with linking and formatting.
