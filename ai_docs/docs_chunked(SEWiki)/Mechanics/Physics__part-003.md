| vi  | : Initial velocity (km/s) |

### Units

Acceleration is always measured with the same time unit as the velocity it's based on. For example, if the object's velocity is measured in km/s, its acceleration would be measured in km/s2.

### Direction

The direction of acceleration is relative to the direction of the velocity. In laymans terms: if the velocity is increasing, the acceleration is positive; If the velocity is decreasing, the acceleration is negative.

For example, if your ship is travelling forwards, it's velocity is positive. So if you are speeding up, the acceleration is positive. If you are slowing down, the acceleration is negative. Similarly, if your ship is travelling backwards, the velocity is negative. So if you are speeding up, the acceleration is negative. If you are slowing down, the acceleration is positive.

If this sounds confusing, think about it this way: assume we're measuring velocity in km/s. So, acceleration is measured in km/s2. Every second, you should be able to add your velocity and the acceleration together to get your new velocity. If you know you're speeding up, but adding your velocity and acceleration and velocity together results in a smaller velocity, then you've got one of your signs wrong. (Keep in mind that "smaller" refers to magnitude, not value. For example, -10km/s is smaller than -20km/s.)

## Force

"_A force is any influence that causes an object to undergo a certain change, either concerning its movement, direction, or geometrical construction. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate, or a flexible object to deform, or both._" — [Wikipedia:Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "wikipedia:Force")

Force can be understood simply as a "push" or a "pull". So it can cause an object to speed up, slow down, change direction, or break.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| F\=m\*a |     |
| _Where:_ |     |
| F   | : Force (N) |
| m   | : Mass (kg) |
| a   | : Acceleration (m/s2) |

## Torque

**Note**: _Torque in Space Engineers, specifically that applied by  [![Icon Block Gyroscope.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Gyroscope.png/21px-Icon_Block_Gyroscope.png?c8eb45)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") [Gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope")s does work according to the real-world physics described here. Research is on-going to determine the nature of in-game torque._

If a force can be thought of as the cause behind a linear acceleration, or deceleration, then a torque is simply the cause behind a rotational acceleration, or rotational deceleration. Simply put, a torque is a rotational force. It is measured in newton meters (Nm) or foot-pounds. Note that this is not newtons per meter. A torque can also be referred to as a moment, or the moment of a force about a point. Moments and torques share the same unit.

Mathematically, torque is defined as:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| T\=F\*r |     |
| _Where:_ |     |
| T   | : Torque (Nm) |
| F   | : Force (N) |
| r   | : Distance between where the force acts, and the axis about which the object will rotate. (m) |
