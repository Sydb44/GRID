## Broadcast Toggle (O)

If the grid has an [antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna"), press 'O' to toggle between passive listening, or actively broadcasting your location. This shortcut is the same as for the player's suit antenna and you cannot switch off your suit antenna while seated in a cockpit.

## And how do I activate anything else?

There are many other custom actions that you may want to control from a cockpit: Enabling overrides on directional thrusters, switching interior or exterior lights, switching locked turret targets, running emergency generators, recharging batteries, starting the jump drive, opening and closing grouped ramps and doors, activating static weapons and tools, and many more.

To assign keyboard shortcuts (the numbers keys) to such actions, configure your cockpit [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") -- details see there.

Tip: To control any other multi-block sequence of actions that is not listed here, create groups on the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") and set up sets of actions inside [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block"). Then toggle the Timer Blocks from the cockpit [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar").

To learn how to specifically control Grid Weapons from a cockpit, see [Block Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons").

1.  [↑](#cite_ref-1 "Jump up") Before release 1.99, the “parking” keyboard shortcut was not configurable and always affected all connectors, landing gear, or wheels, even on connected grids. This famously used to cause unexpected behaviour, such as all grids docked at carriers, bases, or space stations to be inadvertently disconnected and fall or drift away.
