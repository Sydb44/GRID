Large Ion Thrusters use only electricity to provide propulsion to their vessels and are at their best acceleration and braking thrusters in the vacuum of deep space. For a small version, for example for your ship's reaction control system, consider the smaller [Ion Thruster](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ion_Thruster "Ion Thruster"). For an overall comparision, see [Ion Thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ion_Thrusters "Ion Thrusters").

If you have purchased the [Sparks of the Future Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sparks_of_the_Future_Pack "Sparks of the Future Pack") DLC, you can build sci-fi skinned Ion thusters with a sharper thruster flame. If you have purchased the [Warfare 2 Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warfare_2_Pack "Warfare 2 Pack") DLC, you can build rectangular Ion thusters with a more serious military look. All DLC variants have the same functionality, sizes, and recipes.

## Usage

Large Ion thrusters provide efficient and fuel-free propulsion as long as there is a source of power on their grid. They are ideal launching or braking thrusters for ships operating in space.

For docking and manoeuvring at slow speeds, always keep [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers") ([Z key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")) on.

### How to coast

**Thrust Override** controls exists for Ion Thrusters, but it would be a waste of energy to use overrides in space for anything more than short-term acceleration. Instead it's recommended to "coast" in space.

To coast in zero-gravity:

1.  Face the target direction and hold [W key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to accelerate to the desired cruising speed.
2.  Then press [Z key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to switch off [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers").
3.  Let go of [W key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") since you don't need to accelerate anymore.

Drifting in a straight line saves power in zero gravity.

**Tip:** When coasting long distances in space, you typically aim slightly off the target (station, ship, asteroid): This is a safety measure in case you lack the time or energy to fully decelerate and brake, so you don’t collide with the target.

### How to brake while coasting

To brake, simply press [Z key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") again to switch on Inertial Dampers. Braking takes a few seconds, so do it early enough to not hit a station or asteroid!

You brake faster with your strongest thrusters facing forward, so ships with strong rear thrusters do a "flip&burn" manoeuvre to brake faster.

## Construction

If you have [Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") on, you must build a [cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") or [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") first to unlock Ion Thrusters.

Large Ion Thrusters require  [![Icon Item Thruster Components.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Thruster_Components.png/21px-Icon_Item_Thruster_Components.png?a3a389)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster_Components "Thruster Components") [Thruster Components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster_Components "Thruster Components"), which themselves need Platinum, making them expensive and tedious to craft and typically only available in mid to late game.
