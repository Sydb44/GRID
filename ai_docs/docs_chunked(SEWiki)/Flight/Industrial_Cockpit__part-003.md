*   The action in the first slot triggers when you are targeted.
*   The action in the second slot triggers when you have broken out of target lock.

If you want to trigger more than one action, select a [Timer Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") as action, and set up the desired toggle actions inside the Timer block.

### Do cockpits maintain Life Support?

Cockpits offer passive life-support functionality to seated players:

*   Being seated recharges your suit power. An unpowered seat maintains suit power indefinitely but doesn't recharge it.
*   Sitting in an open cockpit in an airtight room, or in a closed cockpit conveyored to a source of oxygen, recharges your suit oxygen while seated.
*   Open cockpits in low oxygen environments do not recharge your oxygen.

## Trivia

A contentious release of a functional block such as the Industrial Cockpit as DLC left many envious, and many confounded. This block is now usable by all players and it will be seen and used in all versions of the game, but the block can only be placed and welded by those who have purchased the Decorative DLC (downloadable content) pack for Space Engineers.

> _**PREMIUM CONTENT FUNCTIONALITY UPDATE: (April 16, 2019)**  
> After carefully evaluating feedback provided by the community, we have decided to make a major change to the functionality of this pack. Soon, all players will be able to interact with these premium blocks regardless of whether they own the Decorative Pack or not. In the case that a player doesn’t own it, they will just not be able to build the blocks. This change will be made in an update releasing in the coming weeks._ -- [Source](https://www.spaceengineersgame.com/game/space-engineers-decorative-pack-1/)
