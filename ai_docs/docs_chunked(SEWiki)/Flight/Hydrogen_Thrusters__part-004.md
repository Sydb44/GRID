*   At 1 MW = 100 L/s, hydrogen thrusters vary from 122.59 kN per MW equivalent (SG small), to 149.38 per MW equivalent (LG large).

This means that ion thrusters are around as efficient on H2 as hydrogen thrusters, and atmospheric thrusters up to 2.5 times as efficient -- but remember, their efficiency degrades with altitude!

## Comparison to Other Thruster Types: Volume

Hydrogen thrusters themselves are quite a bit more space-efficient, in terms of thrust-per-block-volume and thrust-per-surface-area compared to the other two options, especially if one needs to combine both ion and atmospheric for a craft that can operate both in and out of atmosphere. However, hydrogen _storage_ is substantially _less_ space-efficient than electrical energy storage.

For example, a small-grid large hydrogen tank, which is 3x3 (27 blocks of volume), has a capacity of 160 kL of hydrogen. This is equivalent to 0.444 kWh of energy storage when run through the hydrogen engine (10 kW-seconds per litre), or 0.01646 kWh per block. Meanwhile, a small-grid large battery, which is 3x2x3 (18 blocks of volume) can store 1 MWh of power, or 55.5 kWh per block, 3375 times as much energy density as a tank of hydrogen. And note that that's comparing them using the hydrogen engine, hydrogen thrusters are 5 to 25 times _less_ efficient, depending on the thruster alternative being considered. The lack of storage density means that _most_ hydrogen-driven craft must also have an O2/H2 generator on board (or multiple), and the ice to fuel them, increasing mass and decreasing the net thrust advantage. This issue is compounded by the need to run conveyers to all of the thrusters, while electric thrusters merely have to be attached to the grid (how much of a block space cost this is depends on the layout of the craft and any other reasons, such as weapons, that one might need to be running conveyors throughout).

As an example, two small-grid large hydrogen tanks attached to a single large hydrogen thruster requires a total volume of 81 blocks (3x3x9). The tanks have a total capacity of 320 kL, which can fuel the single large hydrogen thruster for 830 seconds of thrust, or ~13.83 minutes. Two small-grid large batteries and a single small-grid large atmospheric thruster, which occupies the same volume of 3x3x9, have a total battery capacity of 2 MWh, or 7200 MW-seconds of energy. That can fuel the single large atmospheric thruster for 3000 seconds, or 50 minutes, while providing 20% more thrust (576 kN from the large atmospheric thruster, versus 480 kN from the large hydrogen).

To minimize the extra internal volume required to run conveyors for the hydrogen thrusters, a common arrangement is to mount large hydrogen thrusters directly onto large hydrogen tanks, though one still needs a method of filling those tanks (either on-board, using an O2/H2 generator, or from an external ship/base via a Connector).
