### Vertical Flight

Some tips for an atmospheric shuttle lifting off vertically from a planet into “orbit”:

1.  Make sure you have additional [Ion](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ion_Thruster "Ion Thruster") or [Hydrogen thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Thruster "Hydrogen Thruster") installed to take over as soon as you reach space!
2.  Create separate [control groups](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Groups "Groups") for the different types of thrusters so you can switch them all on or all off.
3.  Create a separate control group for the atmospheric thrusters that counter gravity in a vertical lift-off.
4.  Add the **Increase** and **Decrease Thrust Override** actions for your lift-off thruster group to your [Tool Bar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar").
5.  After lift-off, increase the **Thrust Override** until you reach a stable maximum acceleration (99m/s), then switch off Inertial Dampers to save power until you reach “orbit”.
6.  When leaving the atmosphere, switch on your Hydrogen/Ion thrusters, reset the thrust override, and switch off the Atmospheric Thrusters.

Switch Inertial Dampers back on while manoeuvring.
