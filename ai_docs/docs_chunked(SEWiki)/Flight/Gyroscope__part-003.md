If [progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is on and you don't see Gyroscopes in your G-menu, build any cockpit first to unlock it.

Gyroscopes need power to function and are very heavy. When placing them, a space engineer needs to find an effective balance between mass and turning speed for each ship.

A Gyroscope takes up a 1x1x1 block space on both small and large ships. It has mount points only on its _bottom_ face. This means that gyroscopes are relatively vulnerable to breaking off when their one mounted blocks gets destroyed, which may suddenly rob a ship of its manoeuvrability. For a less vulnerable alternative, see [Prototech Gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech_Gyroscope "Prototech Gyroscope").

Large-grid gyroscopes feature a control panel on their front side; Small-grid gyroscopes lack this control panel, and they are also too small to carry a [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel "Control Panel"), so their settings can only be accessed from a [cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit")'s or [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control")'s [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").

The _front_ of the gyroscope (for large grid, where the control panel is) determines where which rotational axis will be, not the cockpit orientation. If you place it "the wrong way round", it will still work, but the axes will seem mislabelled. Gyroscope Overrides are easier to configure if you place the gyroscope to face the same way as the cockpit.

### Does placement matter?

Similar to thrusters, gyroscopes apply their effect to the [Center of Mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Center_of_Mass "Center of Mass"), no matter where on the grid you place them. At the same time, due to their high mass, the act of placing them invariably shifts the Center of Mass and the point around which they rotate. Rotation feels more intuitive when the center of mass is where the pilot perceives the center of the ship to be, or where the cockpit is. So keep an eye on the Center of Mass while placing your gyroscopes and make sure it ends up where you expect it to be, and not shifted off to one side.

**Tip:** Open the [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen") and enable Show Center of Mass.
