## Usage

The advantage of Hydrogen Thrusters is that they work equally well in atmosphere as in space. Their disadvantage is that they consume fuel at a very high rate, and the necessary hydrogen tanks are bulky and explosive. For example, use large hydrogen thrusters in one direction to allow planetary lift-off.

## Construction

The Large Hydrogen Thruster has four conveyor ports on each of the four sides perpendicular to the nozzle, and a conveyor port on the side opposite the nozzle.

The thruster requires [Hydrogen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") to operate and can receive it through a powered [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") from a [Hydrogen Tank](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Tank "Hydrogen Tank"). See [Hydrogen Thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Thrusters "Hydrogen Thrusters") for more specifics. As all thrusters, large hydrogen thrusters cause damage to blocks up to 6 blocks length in front of the flame.
