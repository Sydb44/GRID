# Talk:Thruster mechanics - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[PurpleSkyHoliday](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/User:PurpleSkyHoliday "User:PurpleSkyHoliday") (talk) 07:03, January 25, 2017 (UTC): Small edits have been made to the page to make the opening sections more readable. The further calculations section needs to be edited or merged with the forces page entirely

The math formula plugin does not render anymore, needs to be replaced. --[AdaRynin](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/User:AdaRynin "User:AdaRynin") (talk) [14:09, 24 March 2023 (UTC)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Talk:Thruster_mechanics#c-AdaRynin-20230324140900)Reply

The content seems to be referring to thrusters from the Alpha release. --[AdaRynin](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/User:AdaRynin "User:AdaRynin") (talk) [14:10, 24 March 2023 (UTC)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Talk:Thruster_mechanics#c-AdaRynin-20230324141000)Reply
