# Hydrogen Thrusters - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Hydrogen Thrusters were the second type of [thruster](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster "Thruster") to be added to Space Engineers. Instead of using power, they burn [Hydrogen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") gas as fuel to propel a ship in the desired direction.

The industrial variants are reskins that you can build if you own the [Heavy Industry Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Heavy_Industry_Pack "Heavy Industry Pack").

## Usage

For the hydrogen thrusters to work, remember to disable **Stockpile** on the Hydrogen tanks when undocking. Also make sure that the [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") is intact and has power to transport the hydrogen from the tanks to the thrusters -- the conveyor lights must be green.

  
Typically, you will use large thrusters in one direction for lift-off, and several small thrusters in all directions as reaction control system (RCS).

### How to save fuel by using Control Groups

As with all thrusters it's recommended to create [control groups](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Groups "Groups"), one for all RCS thrusters, and one for only the lift-off thrusters. This allows you to switch on/off different sets of thrusters when needed. For example, switch off the large thrusters while steering carefully close to asteroids in zero gravity, switch them on for takeoff, landing, and de/acceleration.

If you intend to fly horizontally in gravity, you must keep [Inertia Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampeners "Inertial Dampeners") on, but they waste fuel by engaging your braking thrusters (the fore thrusters) needlessly. Create a control group for your braking thrusters so that you can coast forwards with [Inertia Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampeners "Inertial Dampeners") switched on, and braking thrusters switched off. To brake, reenable the braking thruster group again!

### How to save fuel by using Thruster Overrides

Accelerating ("holding [W key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")") and pushing against the artificial speed limit wastes hydrogen. When you configure your [Tool Bar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar"), not only add on/off toggles for your thruster groups and Hydrogen Tank Stockpile, but also add **Increase** and **Decrease Thrust Override** controls for the lift-off thruster group. Instead of having to hold [W key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") down the whole way, use these controls to increase and decrease constant thrust, like a throttle.

1.  Lift off and accelerate up manually by holding [W key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
2.  Once you hit the maximum speed of 100 m/s, let go of the key and tap **Increase Thrust Override** about a dozen times until you maintain that speed.
3.  When planetary gravity starts decreasing, carefully tap **Decrease Thrust Override** to back off the fuel usage while keeping your speed at 99 m/s.

At lower and lower gravity, less and less override is needed to maintain the escape velocity. In space, switch off the override and fly as usual using WASD keys (and Inertial Dampers).
