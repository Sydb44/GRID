# Thruster mechanics - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The [Thruster](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster "Thruster") is a mobility block in Space Engineers.

The primary function of a thruster is to provide ships with the ability to move. When turned on, the thruster applies force in the direction opposite to its exhaust. To activate thrusters, either press the movement keys in a [cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit"), or activate the thruster's manual override in the control panel.

Each thruster can push ships in only one direction, so for conventional ship designs it's recommended to build thrusters in all 6 directions.

*   As a physics simplification in the game, each thruster's force is applied to the [Center of Mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Center_of_Mass "Center of Mass"), no matter where it actually is located on the ship. Asymmetrical thruster placement will not cause tailspinning.
*   Thruster help counteract inertia in zero gravity. Inertia after a thruster burn makes a ship coast (drift). Enable [inertial dampeners](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_dampeners "Inertial dampeners") to slow the ship down by automatically burning the right counter thrusters.
*   Thrusters help fight against planetary gravity, so ensure that you have enough lifting thrusters for landers and shuttles.

While thrusters can be placed anywhere on a ship, they require 4-5 blocks of clear space to avoid damaging other objects. Small ship thrusters, do not damage heavy armour blocks. Thruster Damage can be toggled on and off in world settings, allowing for different ship designs.

Thrusters provide only linear movement to the ship (up/down, left/right, backwards/forwards). To rotate (roll, yaw, or pitch), you must build [Gyroscopes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope").

## Capacity

When active, [inertial dampeners](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_dampeners "Inertial dampeners") can use 100% of the maximum capacity of all necessary thrusters.

The thrust required to lift your ship takes the [Blocks Inventory Size](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings#Characters_inventory_size_/_Blocks_inventory_size "World Settings") setting into account. The mass of all of the cargo in your ship is divided by the multiplier's setting, so the same number of thrusters will be required regardless of what setting you play with.

## Calculating acceleration

According to [physics](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Physics "Physics"), we know that [force](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Physics#Force "Physics") = [mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Physics#Mass "Physics") x [acceleration](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Physics#Acceleration "Physics"). Using algebra, we can then determine that acceleration = force / mass. But what does this mean, exactly?

#### Units

*   Force: Newtons (N), 1 N = 1 kgm/s2
*   Mass: Kilograms (kg)
*   Acceleration: meters per second per second (m/s2)

#### Constants

*   Inertial dampeners use thrusters' maximum power.
*   Small Ion Thruster:
    *   Small ship:

A **Thruster** is [\[1\]](#cite_note-1) a small rocket engine on a spacecraft used to make controlled alterations in its flight path or altitude. You may be looking for [Thruster Comparison](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster_Comparison "Thruster Comparison").

## Usage

In Space Engineers, the thruster is the keystone block for all flying craft: airplanes, shuttles, drones, [missiles](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Built_Weapons "Player Built Weapons"), or spaceships. [Build](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") at _least one_ thruster block facing in each cardinal direction (plus a source of [Power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power") and a [Gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope")) to be able to stabilize and achieve controlled flight with a mobile grid.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) Asymmetrical thruster placement is allowed and will not cause tailspinning, as it would in real life or Kerbal Space Program.

The max speed is capped at 100 meters per second (360 km per hour) due to limitations of the physics engine that causes faster objects to phase through obstacles.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)

Thrusters use up 12 [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU").
