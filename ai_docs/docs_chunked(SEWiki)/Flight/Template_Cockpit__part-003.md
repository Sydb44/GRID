### Do cockpits maintain Life Support?

Cockpits offer passive life-support functionality to seated players:

*   Being seated recharges your suit power. An unpowered seat maintains suit power indefinitely but doesn't recharge it.
*   Sitting in an open cockpit in an airtight room, or in a closed cockpit conveyored to a source of oxygen, recharges your suit oxygen while seated.
*   Open cockpits in low oxygen environments do not recharge your oxygen.
