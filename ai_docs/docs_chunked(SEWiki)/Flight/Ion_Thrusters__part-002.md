## Trivia

Ion thrusters were originally the only type of thruster in Space Engineers. Once [Atmospheric](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Atmospheric_Thrusters "Atmospheric Thrusters") and [Hydrogen Thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Thrusters "Hydrogen Thrusters") were added, Keen Software House decided to make these thrusters "more-end-game orientated", making them require Platinum to craft their  [![Icon Item Thruster Components.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/5/51/Icon_Item_Thruster_Components.png/21px-Icon_Item_Thruster_Components.png?a3a389)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster_Components "Thruster Components") [Thruster Components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster_Components "Thruster Components"). Internally in the game files, ions are still simply called "thrust."

In real life, ion thrusters are used by spacecraft such as the [Dawn probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_\(spacecraft\)) which excites charged molecules to produce thrust. Currently, they are favored for long-distance space craft due to their fuel efficiency and reliability. However, unlike in Space Engineers, most current and practical forms of ion propulsion do consume some manner of fuel. Ion thrusters also make common appearances in many contemporary fictional settings as a slower but more efficient or reliable form of deep space propulsion.

## Construction

If you have [Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") enabled, you must build a [cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") or  [![Icon Block Remote Control.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/0/0d/Icon_Block_Remote_Control.png/21px-Icon_Block_Remote_Control.png?e33c2d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") first to unlock Ion Thrusters. They require  [![Icon Item Thruster Components.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/5/51/Icon_Item_Thruster_Components.png/21px-Icon_Item_Thruster_Components.png?a3a389)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster_Components "Thruster Components") [Thruster Components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster_Components "Thruster Components"), which are expensive to craft, requiring rare metals including [Platinum](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Platinum "Platinum"), which is only found on asteroids and moons. Because of this, Ion thrusters are typically only available in mid to late game.

Ion thrusters' compact design gives them more surface areas for attaching to other blocks, making them a lot easier to design and build around compared to the round Atmospheric thrusters or conveyor-dependent Hydrogen thrusters.

Ion thrusters for small grids have the smallest mass compared to their counterparts, however the inverse is true for Large grids; large grid Ion thrusters are bigger and heavier than their sister thrusters.
