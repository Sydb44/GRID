# Argentavis mk.1 2 no factory

[![Argentavis .jpg](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Argentavis_.jpg/370px-Argentavis_.jpg?e61762)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Argentavis_.jpg)

The Argentavis is an NPC ship that is part of the [Learning to Survive Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Learning_to_Survive_Scenario "Learning to Survive Scenario"). It is a high risk/high reward encounter.

## Trivia

The original encounter used to be notorious for its aggressiveness and the ship's relentless stalking of players. Since then, its attack strategy was changed, and since the Warfare update, players also have much better weapons at their disposal to defend themselves, balancing the odds.

This ship was named after the largest flying bird known to have existed in the current fossil record, the prehistoric bird itself being named after the country it was found in, Argentina.

## Spoilers

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

  
The Argentavis appears in the [Learning to Survive Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Learning_to_Survive_Scenario "Learning to Survive Scenario") as the antagonist commanderâ€™s ship after defeating the pirate base. This makes the Argentavis the first mini-boss of the Space Engineers world.

Argentavis used to be the most dangerous vessel in any Space Engineers scenario, at least it was during its debut. In a pre-1.0 update, Keen removed its ability to continually summon other Argentavis, which used to create a flock of aggressive Argentavis, swarming the engineers.

When triggered towards the end of the [Learning to Survive Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Learning_to_Survive_Scenario "Learning to Survive Scenario") today, the Argentavis continues to attack players from a safe distance around 8-12km away. Should players try to escape, it continuously stalks its prey and calls in dangerous drones, such as the [Dyad](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Dyad "Dyad"). To stop the onslaught of its [Incisor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Incisor_mk.1 "Incisor mk.1"), [Dyad](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Dyad "Dyad"), and [Barb](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Barb_mk.1 "Barb mk.1") drones, players need to disable its Antenna, labelled "Heavy Drone Manufacturing Started".

Upon capture and grinding down of the cockpit, reactor, and medical room, a series of special Cargo ships may start spawning into the Engineers' world.
