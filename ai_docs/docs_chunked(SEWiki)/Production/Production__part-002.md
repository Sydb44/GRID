### Which item is best to recycle to get needed materials?

You urgently need one last material to complete production, and you want to identify the least needed item to sacrifice for the most outcome?

First make sure the Assembler is in Disassembly mode.

The Production tab now shows three columns:

*   In the right column, hover the mouse over which items you have, that you can recycle.
*   In the middle column, it now shows you the total materials (ingots) to gain if you recycle it.

Compare the values to find the best candidate for your situation.

### Why did production halt?

First, verify that you have the required materials in your grid's inventory.

If you are out of required input materials, production halts until you supply more. This can also happen if the assembler's input inventory is full of the wrong materials (e.g. overflowing with gravel). Drag some materials into another inventory to give the Assembler room to pull the required materials.

Assemblers will not pull available ingots from conveyored Survivals Kits. Drag and drop materials out of the Survival Kit manually.

  
Next, verify whether you are in _Assembly_ or _Disassembly_ mode.

If you are certain you have the materials in a conveyored cargo container, check whether you can manually drag and drop the materials into the assembler on the inventory screen. If not, check for directional Sorters and broken conveyor tubes.

In early-game bases, running out of [power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power") is also a factor that halts production.

## Inventory

*   The Refinery's input inventory accepts only [Ores](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ore "Ore").
*   The Refinery's output inventory accepts only [Materials](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material").
*   The Assembler's input inventory accepts only [Materials](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material").
*   The Assembler's output inventory accepts the [Component](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component"), Equipment, Consumable, and Tool type [items](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item") that it can produce.

## Progression

You build up your production chain as follows, no matter whether the [progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") option is on or off.

1.  First, you start with a [Survival kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_kit "Survival kit") which can refine  [![Icon Item Stone.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Stone.png/21px-Icon_Item_Stone.png?38f36b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Stone "Stone") [Stone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Stone "Stone") and produce basic components and tools.
2.  With the components it produces, you build the [Basic Refinery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Basic_Refinery "Basic Refinery") and the [Basic Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Basic_Assembler "Basic Assembler").
3.  To be able to (dis)assemble advanced components and to refine all ores, you finally build an [(advanced) Refinery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery") and an [(advanced) Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler").
4.  Optionally, you add [Upgrade Modules](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Upgrade_Modules "Upgrade Modules").

## Production Tips

*   Can't recall the needed components? Assemblers are integrated with the [Build Planner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Build_Planner "Build Planner")!
*   Connecting your production blocks and some cargo containers to a [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") is immensely helpful in keeping production running smoothly. Production blocks can pull through conveyors what they need, and push their output into cargo containers when their inventories are full, so you don't need to do it manually.
*   Can't find the right [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") in the [Inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory")? Select it on the [Production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") tab and click **Inventory** in the bottom right to jump to it quickly.
*   Can't find the right [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") in the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen")? Select it on the [Production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") tab and click **Control Panel** in the bottom right to jump to it quickly.
