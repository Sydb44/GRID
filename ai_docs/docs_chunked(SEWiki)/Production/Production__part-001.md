# Category:Production - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Production blocks refine [ores](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ores "Ores") into [materials](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material"), and assemble and disassemble [items](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item"). The factory block category includes [Refineries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery"), [Basic Assemblers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Basic_Assembler "Basic Assembler"), [Assemblers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler"), and [Survival Kits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_kit "Survival kit").

Assembly means turning ingots into components; disassembly means turning components back into ingots. Be aware which mode you are in.

## Usage

### How to open the Production tab

The **Production** tab in the [Terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal") lets you control factory devices, if any exist on this grid. As a shortcut, target a production facility inventory [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") and press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the **Production** tab.

If there are several Assembly-capable blocks on a single ship or station, select specific Assemblers or Survival Kits on the Production tab from a drop-down menu.

### How to refine ores

Though part of the production process, _refineries_ are not listed in the Production tab. That's because they pull ores automatically (see also [Conveyor Sorter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Sorter "Conveyor Sorter") for more control) and don't have any other user interaction.

Queue up ores simply by placing them in the Refineriesâ€™ [Inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") tab. The refinery processes the ores from left to right.

### How to assemble components

Most of usage is the same for Survival Kit, Basic Assembler, and Assembler, even if only "Assembler" is mentioned here. The difference is that Survival Kit and Basic Assembler are restricted and cannot produce late-game components.

Basic Assemblers and Survival Kits habe the same UI but let you choose fewer items from the Blueprint tabs.

Requirement: Any Assembler requires refined [materials](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material") in its inventory. Either insert them manually, or let the Assembler pull materials from a [conveyored](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") cargo container or Refinery.

On the **Production** tab:

1.  On the left side: If you have several, select a specific Assembler.
2.  On the right side, make sure that it is in Assembler Mode.
3.  On the left side, browse through the Blueprint tabs and click the item that you want to produce. Hover the mouse pointer for tooltips.  
    Available blueprints categories are:
    *   Large Grid Blocks
    *   Small Grid Blocks
    *   Components
    *   Equipment
    *   Tools
    *   Weapons
    *   Ammunition
    *   Components needed for blocks in your [Build Planner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Build_Planner "Build Planner") queue
4.  Verify you see the items queued up on the right side.
    *   To reprioritise items, drag&drop queued items on the right side so the urgent ones are leftmost in the queue.
    *   To cancel production of an item, click it in the queue on the right side to remove it.

The assembled items are output into the [Inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory").

### How many components will I need to produce this block?

Make sure the Assembler is in Assembler mode.

The Production tab has three columns:

*   In the left column, hover the mouse over which block you want to produce.
*   In the middle column, it shows you the total needed materials, out of how many you have in storage.
*   In the right column, it lists the equivalent total required components.

This is useful information so you can plan ahead in early game to hand-mine just enough common materials to upgrade to the next tier; or in late game, so you gather enough rare materials to build endgame blocks; and to prepare for speedruns.

### How to recyle components

If you have looted some items and are lacking certain materials, you can extract the materials by disassembly. (Basic) Assemblers can recycle items back into materials, destroying the item but returning the same amount of materials as it took to create it. The Basic Assembler can only disassemble the items it knows how to produce. The Survival Kit cannot do disassembly.

On the **Production** tab:

1.  On the left side, select an Assembler if you have several.
2.  On the left side, browse through the Blueprint tabs and find the items you want to recycle. Hover the mouse pointer to read tooltips.
3.  On the right side, make sure that you are in '''Disassembly''' Mode.
4.  On the left side, click the icons to start recycling items.  
    The items are queued up on the right side.
5.  If you need to reprioritise, drag&drop queued items on the right side to reorder them.
6.  To cancel recycling of an item (maybe because you still need it), click it in the right-side queue to remove it.

The recycled materials are output into the assembler's input [Inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory").

### Which item is best to recycle to get needed materials?

You urgently need one last material to complete production, and you want to identify the least needed item to sacrifice for the most outcome?

First make sure the Assembler is in Disassembly mode.

The Production tab now shows three columns:

*   In the right column, hover the mouse over which items you have, that you can recycle.
*   In the middle column, it now shows you the total materials (ingots) to gain if you recycle it.

Compare the values to find the best candidate for your situation.
