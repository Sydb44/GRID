    Reduces the power usage of the Refinery. This can be very useful at the beginning of the game or during an emergency.

Examples:

*   If you are starved for power, use 4 efficiency modules.
*   If you have only very little ore, use 4 yield modules.
*   If power is not an issue, use 4 speed modules.
*   Use Sorters to send slow-refining ores to a speed-maximised refinery and send rare ores to a yield-maximised refinery.
*   Or you can mix and match these modules: For instance, add 1 Yield Module, 1 Power Efficiency Module and 2 Speed Modules, to get 200% increase to the speed while keeping the power consumption low and yielding a few more ores per kg.

And so on.

## Power

The Refinery works at maximum speed when supplied with 560 kW of power. Supplying it with less will cause it to stutter and process ores slower, but it will still be functional.

## Inventory

With Realistic settings, the Refinery has two [inventories](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"), both with a capacity of 7,500 L on large ships and stations.

*   The input inventory accepts and pulls only [ore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ore "Ore") type items.
*   The output inventory accepts and pushes only [material](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material") type items. It stores some of the ingots that have just been processed.

Ores are processed from left to right in the order you insert them into the input inventory. You can drag and drop them to prioritise.

If the refinery is attached to a [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") or placed with its ports directly touching other conveyor ports:

*   The input inventory can receive pushed ores from other inventories (such as a docked miner).
*   The output inventory can push materials to other blocks that need ores (such as assemblers).
*   If it is running out of ores to refine, it will automatically pull ores from other inventories (such as cargo containers).
*   If its output inventory is full, it will overflow and automatically push materials (including gravel) into other inventories.

## Construction

The Refinery without upgrade modules takes up 2x2x4 blocks, having a square footprint and being quite tall, and 2x3x4 with upgrade modules. It exists only for large grids.

It has 4 conveyor / inventory [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port"): One on the front near the base, one on the back, one on a bottom face and one on the top. It has mount points on its top and bottom face, as well as the first block around its base on the other four sides.

If you intend to benefit from [Upgrade Modules](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Upgrade_Modules "Upgrade Modules"), consider the extra block space needed for each, and that modules potentially cover up conveyor ports.
