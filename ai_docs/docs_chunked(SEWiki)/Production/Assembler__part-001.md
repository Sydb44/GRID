The  [![Icon Block Assembler.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Assembler.png/21px-Icon_Block_Assembler.png?ceefab)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") Assembler is a functional [block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block") in Space Engineers. You control its functionality through the [Production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") tab.

The Assembler is the advanced variant of the  [![Icon Block Basic Assembler.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Basic_Assembler.png/21px-Icon_Block_Basic_Assembler.png?8d0c2d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Basic_Assembler "Basic Assembler") [Basic Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Basic_Assembler "Basic Assembler") and  [![Icon Block Survival Kit.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Survival_Kit.png/21px-Icon_Block_Survival_Kit.png?ac91f9)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit") [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit"); the  [![Icon Block Industrial Assembler.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Industrial_Assembler.png/21px-Icon_Block_Industrial_Assembler.png?cb69fe)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Industrial_Assembler "Industrial Assembler") [Industrial Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Industrial_Assembler "Industrial Assembler") is a reskin with same functionality but different size. This block is essential to be able to produce components for mid- and end-game blocks. It also has better blueprint queuing than its basic variant.

## Usage

Engineers use Assemblers to assemble [components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component") (crafting). Its secondary function is disassembly (recycling).

1.  Provide the assembler with materials, for example:
    *   Fill the Assembler's inventory with materials manually.
    *   Connect it to a Cargo Container filled with materials.
    *   Connect its conveyor ports to a (Basic) Refinery filled with ores.
2.  Press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") screen.
3.  Choose one of two modes, and queue up items:
    *   Assembler - craft items
    *   Disassembler - recycle items

Tip: To queue up items in separate assemblers on a single ship, use the drop-down menu in the top-left corner of the production tab to select a specific assembler to interact with.

Find usage details in the [Production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") article.

On the [Production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") screen, you can configure your Assembler to run in different modes, Cooperative Mode and Repeat Mode.

### How to make multiple assemblers cooperate

If you have several Assemblers in the same conveyor network, configure them on the [Production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") screen to run in **Cooperative Mode**.

This mode makes them parallelise their workload, and you get components faster.

1.  Build several Assemblers in the same [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system").
2.  Set the one you will interact with to be the primary assembler and disable "Cooperative Mode" in it.
3.  Enable "Cooperative Mode" in all the secondary Assemblers.
4.  Put [materials](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material") into a conveyored cargo container.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)
5.  Queue up components.  
    The secondary Assemblers will pull materials from cargo containers and distribute the workload automatically.

Important: Queue up components only on the primary assembler! Either interact with a port of the primary assemble when queuing up components, or make sure to select the primary assembler from the top left menu on the Production screen.

Pros are increased speed and free mount points for Power Efficiency modules. Cons are the higher build and CPU costs because you’re building several assemblers instead of using [speed modules](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Speed_Module "Speed Module").

### How to find an Assembler's inventory fast

When you have several Assemblers, you need a way to access their inventory quickly: On the Assembler's [Production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") tab, click **Inventory** in the bottom right to go directly to its [Inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") tab.

### How to find an Assembler's Control Panel fast

When you have several Assemblers, you need a way to access their control panel quickly: On the Assembler's [Production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") tab, click **Control Panel** in the bottom right to go directly to its [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").

### How to mass produce items

If you are doing mass production (or mass recycling), configure your assembler on the [Production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") screen to run in **Repeat Mode**. This mode automatically repeats the current queue when ever it can pull the items needed.

Usage example: Automatic recycling

1.  Set aside one Assembler in the Conveyor system.
2.  Disable **Cooperative Mode** on it.
3.  Enable **Repeat Mode** on it.
4.  Queue up disassembling recipes for all items that you always want to get rid of when ever they enter the conveyor system.
