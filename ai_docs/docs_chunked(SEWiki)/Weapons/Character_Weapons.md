Character [Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") are special offensive [tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Tools "Character Tools") that engineers carry in their inventory.

They are the player equivalent of [Block Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") for ships and stations.

## Requirements

In [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"), the engineers will need to carry suitable [ammunition](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ammunition "Ammunition") in their inventories, otherwise the weapons can't be reloaded and won't work.

You [craft](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") these from the Weapons and Ammo tabs of the [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler").

## Available Hand Weapons

## Usage

You can use handheld weapons on foot to shoot players, [Sabiroids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sabiroids "Sabiroids"), [Cyberhounds](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cyberhounds "Cyberhounds"), and to "remotely" destroy blocks, such as defensive turrets, light armor, antennas, or drone thrusters.

Prerequisites:

1.  Have the weapon and its ammo items in your inventory.
2.  While not seated, press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to configure your [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar").
3.  In the **Character Weapon** category, drag and drop the weapon to a toolbar slot.
4.  Press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the G menu.

After you have the weapon on your toolbar:

1.  Press the slot number to wield the weapon.
2.  Press [R key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to load [ammunition](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ammunition "Ammunition").
3.  Hold [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") to aim down sights (zoom).
4.  Press [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to shoot.

The numbers in the toolbar slot indicate how much ammo you have left.

## Tip

You may be able to assemble a handheld rocket launcher early on -- but not its ammo, which needs uranium. So remember to loot ammo from wrecks and to hack enemy rocket launchers and turrets and collect their ammo.
