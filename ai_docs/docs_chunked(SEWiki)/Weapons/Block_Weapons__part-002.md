### How to configure manual shooting

When configuring Block Weapons in the [G-menu toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") of your cockpit, it makes a difference whether you use the entry from the **Block Weapons** filter or from the **All Blocks** filter!

### How to configure automatic shooting (AI)

If an automatic turret wastes ammo because it's shooting at wreck debris, you'll want to be able to quickly disable its auto-targetting. When configuring the [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar"), also assign slots to the following auto-targetting controls so you can change them smartly on the fly.

Relevant AI controls include:

1.  Set an **AI Aiming Radius** in metres. Set your primary point defences to maximum-range, and hide secondary turrets with different angles and a lower aiming radius to ambush boarders.
2.  Choose _one or several_ automatic targets from this list:
    *   meteors, rockets, characters, stations,
    *   large ships, small ships,
    *   neutrals, friends, enemies
3.  Select _one_ of the following automatic **Subsystem Target Options**:
    *   Default -- Makes the AI destroy the first visible subsystem block (power, weapons, or propulsion).
    *   Weapons -- Makes the AI focus on destroying static Weapons, Turrets, Warheads, first. Good to detooth armed ships and stations.
    *   Propulsion -- Makes the AI focus on destroying Thrusters, Gyroscopes, and Jump Drives first. Good against [PBW](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Built_Weapons "Player Built Weapons") or fleeing vessels. Disabled mobile targets may drift off or crash. Useless against stations.
    *   Power Systems -- Makes the AI focus on destroying Batteries, Solar Panels, Wind Turbines, H2 Engines, and Reactors first. Good to shut down stations and ships, but only useful if their power subsystems are exposed. Disabled mobile targets may drift off or crash.

Turrets additionally benefit from manual [Target Locking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Target_Locking "Target Locking"). Many of these settings are shared with [Custom Turret Controllers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Custom_Turret_Controller "Custom Turret Controller") and combat [Automatons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automaton "Automaton").

Regarding the targetting priority of automated turrets, you should also know about [Decoys](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decoy "Decoy").

Turrets display conspicuous seeking behavior when idle, which can alert intruders to their presence, but you can [configure](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") them to remain still. On servers, they do not move when idle.

### How to aim automatic turrets manually

The  [![Icon Block Control Station.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Control_Station.png/21px-Icon_Block_Control_Station.png?72bc2e)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Station "Control Station") [Control Station](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Station "Control Station") is disabled by a railgun hit? Assume manual turret control from any seat (!) by opening the turret's [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") and clicking the **Control** button:

1.  See through the "eyes" of the turret and use the mouse scroll wheel to aim down sights (zoom in).
2.  Aim and shoot using [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right").
3.  If in a cockpit, continue to drive/fly using the WASD keys.
4.  Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to release turret control.

Put **Subsystem Target Options** switching actions on your toolbar to react tactically. The best choice depends on the location of the battle and whether your priority is to detooth or to capture a vessel. For example:

*   Targetting enemy propulsion above your planetary base comes with the risk of the ships crashing down on you, but may be the safest option in zero gravity to make missiles or cargo ships drift off course.
*   Accidentally targeting propulsion against a base, or targeting weapons against a kinetic missile, may cost you your victory, so be prepared to switch.
