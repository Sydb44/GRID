### How to aim automatic turrets manually

The  [![Icon Block Control Station.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Control_Station.png/21px-Icon_Block_Control_Station.png?72bc2e)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Station "Control Station") [Control Station](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Station "Control Station") is disabled by a railgun hit? Assume manual turret control from any seat (!) by opening the turret's [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") and clicking the **Control** button:

1.  See through the "eyes" of the turret and use the mouse scroll wheel to aim down sights (zoom in).
2.  Aim and shoot using [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right").
3.  If in a cockpit, continue to drive/fly using the WASD keys.
4.  Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to release turret control.

Put **Subsystem Target Options** switching actions on your toolbar to react tactically. The best choice depends on the location of the battle and whether your priority is to detooth or to capture a vessel. For example:

*   Targetting enemy propulsion above your planetary base comes with the risk of the ships crashing down on you, but may be the safest option in zero gravity to make missiles or cargo ships drift off course.
*   Accidentally targeting propulsion against a base, or targeting weapons against a kinetic missile, may cost you your victory, so be prepared to switch.

### How to optimise reload time

If you are using multiple weapons with very slow reload times, don't [group](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Groups "Groups") them to shoot at the same time!

Switch from one to the other, and shoot one while the other reloads.

### How to distinguish friend from foe?

You can use the [Factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") screen to declare war or peace, but what about neutrals or grids that are not broadcasting?

Unload the ammo from one unconveyored turret and set the turret to aim at "neutrals" and "allies". The turret now silently indicates other players' presence on your faction's [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") with a white [signal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal"), without shooting.

## Weapon Damage

For a detailed damage comparisons, see also[Damage Mechanics](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics "Damage Mechanics").

*   Weapons with the lowest damage are the compact and lightweight gatlings and interior turrets.
*   The medium sized Rocket Launchers, Rocket Turrets, and Autocannons do medium damage.
*   In the top damage ranges, we see heavy and unwieldy weapons, such as Assault Cannons, with the slow Artilleries and Railguns taking the top ranks.

Tip: Choose high damage when you have time and opportunity to aim (possibly even manually), for example, because the enemy ships are large or slow.

## Weapon Damage Per Second (dps)

If you consider reload time, you are looking at damage _per second_ (dps).

*   Interior turrets, Rocket Turrets, and small Railguns rank lowest.
*   Small Assault Cannons, Rocket Launchers, and Gatling Turrets are in the middle dps ranges.
*   Autocannons, Large Railguns, and large Assault Cannon Turrets have high dps, only topped by the sluggish Artilleries having the highest dps.

Tip: Choose high dps turrets when you have lots of ammo to spend on chasing small or fast moving targets.

## Construction

Certain weapon blocks exist only for small grid (like the Autocannon), or only for large grids (like the Artillery), while most of them exist in both sizes.

Some Block Weapons pull ammunition through [conveyor ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") while others have to be reloaded manually, so consider port accessibility before placing them.

Important: Block weapons are among the blocks with the highest [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU") cost, so don't just cover your ship hull in guns.
