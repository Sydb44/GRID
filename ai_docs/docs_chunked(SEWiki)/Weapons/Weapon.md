Handheld weapon for players

Weapons are special tools in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") that cause [damage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics "Damage Mechanics") to blocks and player health, and can cause player [death](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death") and block destruction, which has an impact on a player's [faction reputation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions").

## Usage

In Survival Mode, weapons must be loaded with [Ammunition](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ammunition "Ammunition") of the right type, there are no "electric" laser guns.

Weapons are used against by engineers against other engineers when following "player versus player" (PvP) rules, and against computer controlled enemies (non-player characters, NPCs, drones) when following "player versus environment" (PvE) rules.

In single-player games, only PvE is possible by definition. In multiplayer, players have to agree among each other about fair use of weapons. Space Engineers as a sandbox game does not enforce one or the other rule set.

## Weapon Types

There are three types of weapons in Space Engineers, hand-held weapons for players, weapon blocks for ships and stations, and Player-Built Weapons (PBWs).

### Character Weapons

[Character Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons") are special tools including handguns, rifles, and rocket launchers, that engineers carry in their inventories.

Tip: You can "peacefully" test weapons against a [Target Dummy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Target_Dummy "Target Dummy").

### Block Weapons

You build [Block Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") on and in your stations, rovers, mechs, and ships to provide them with defensive and offensive capabilities.

### Player Built Weapons

[Player-Built Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Built_Weapons "Player Built Weapons") (short: PBW) are any mobile grids that players [build](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") and use like missiles to cause damage to grids and players, other than the standard Character Weapons and Block Weapons.
