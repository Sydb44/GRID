The Artillery Turret is a large-grid automatic [Block Weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons"). This huge capital battleship turret was designed for long-range engagements. It provides devastating firepower against even the most heavily armoured targets. It is however quite ineffective against small and fast targets due to its slow tracking speed and overall limited mobility.

## Damage

The bulky, heavy Artillery Turret is known for its slow rate of fire and slow reload time, paired with the highest damage-per-second and farthest trajectory and range. Each shell does a devastating 17000 penetration damage.

*   17,000 [penetration damage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics#Penetration_Damage "Damage Mechanics").
*   [Ricochet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics#Ricochet "Damage Mechanics"): 85% chance from 0 to 10 degrees surface angle, then chance linearly scales to 25% until 40 degrees, past that angle it no longer ricochets.
    *   If it ricochets: 7,000 damage dealt to the hit block and subtracted from penetration damage.
*   Precision: 1.05m group at 100m (up to 0.3 degrees random offset from aiming line).
*   Fires up to 2 rounds (80 RPM) and then reloads for 12 seconds (resulting in roughly 10 RPM overall).
*   Round travels at 500m/s, vanishes after travelling 2,000m and it is affected by [natural gravity](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity "Gravity").
*   150 kN recoil force applied to ship.
*   The projectile is a missile type and because of that it can be targeted and destroyed by turrets having "Target Rockets" enabled.

## Turret

*   The Artillery Turret can automatically aim and shoot at target types designated in its terminal, by default enemy large-grid ships.
*   It has a configurable detection range up to 800m.
*   Can only target these types: SmallGrids, LargeGrids, Stations; of which can be Enemies or Neutrals.
*   The turret rotates slow at 11 degrees per second and is limited between -15 and 60 degrees elevation.

## Construction

It is 3x3x3 blocks in size and its only mount point is on the bottom.

## Power

The Artillery Turret consumes 2 kW of power all the time while turned on. Firing or different ranges do not affect power usage.

## Inventory

Its inventory can hold 600L, which corresponds to six [Artillery Shells](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artillery_Shell "Artillery Shell") as ammunition. Artillery Shells are among the more expensive ammunitions, because they require Uranium.  
It has one conveyor [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") on the bottom side to automatically pull ammo from the [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system").
