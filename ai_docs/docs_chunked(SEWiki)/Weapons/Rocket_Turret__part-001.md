The  [![Icon Block Rocket Turret.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/c/ca/Icon_Block_Rocket_Turret.png/21px-Icon_Block_Rocket_Turret.png?1a8cbb)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket_Turret "Rocket Turret") Rocket Turret is a [Block Weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") that shoots rockets. The [Rocket Turret Type II](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket_Turret_Type_II "Rocket Turret Type II") is a DLC variant.

## Usage

It is an automated defense weapon which fires [Rockets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket "Rocket"), allowing it to take out even [Large Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid"). The Rocket Turret will automatically fire upon target types defined in the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"). Be aware that due to their slow speed, rockets are rather ineffective against quickly maneuvering [Small Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid") and meteors, but come into their element when used against [Large Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") and Stations.

The enemy detection range is configurable in terminal up to 600m for smallgrid or 800m for largegrid.

For usage details, see [Block Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons").

## Damage

*   500 [explosive damage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics "Damage Mechanics") with 4m radius
*   Precision: 1.75m group at 100m (up to 0.5 degrees random offset from aiming line).
*   90 RPM fire rate
    *   Small-grid: fires up to 2 rounds until it has to reload for 6 seconds
    *   Large-grid: fires up to 6 rounds until it has to reload for 4 seconds
*   Rocket travels at 200m/s, self-detonates after travelling 800m and it is not affected by [natural gravity](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity "Gravity").
*   The projectile is a missile type and because of that it can be targeted and destroyed by turrets having "Target Rockets" enabled.

## Turret

*   The Rocket Turret can automatically aim and shoot at target types designated in its terminal, by default enemy ships.
*   It has a configurable detection range up to 600m for small-grid and 800m for large-grid version.
*   Can only target these types: Characters, SmallGrids, LargeGrids, Stations; of which can be Enemies or Neutrals.
*   The large-grid turret rotates at 55 degrees per second and is limited between -58 and 90 degrees elevation.
*   The small-grid turret rotates faster at 82.51 degrees per second and is limited between -8 and 90 degrees elevation.

## Construction

Since the turret is moving and has big barrels, it takes 3x3x3 free blocks of space to build it. Keep it as free as possible so it does not destroy itself with its own splash damage.  
It has a large conveyor port at the bottom and it only has mountpoint at the bottom side. You can build it on small and large grid and [Stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Station "Station") only.

## Power

The Rocket Turret consumes 2 kW of power all the time while turned on. Firing or different ranges do not affect power usage.

## Inventory

Rocket Turrets have an inventory with a volume of 384 L on large-grid or 120 L on small-grid (with Realistic settings).  
It will only accept [Rockets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") as ammunition, of which it can hold 6 on large-grid or 2 on small-grid.  
If connected to a [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") (requires large ports), the turret will pull ammo from containers when its supply runs low.
