# Block Weapons - Official Space Engineers Wiki

You [build](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") [weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") blocks on your stations, rovers, mechs, and ships to provide grids with defensive and offensive capabilities. They are the stations' and ships' equivalents of handheld [Character Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons").

## Available Weapon Blocks

*   (manual) = Requires players to manually place the ammo in this block's inventory, cannot use conveyors.
*   (rng) = Range randomized between 80% and 100% of the printed value on every shot.
*   (variable) = Railgun reload time is limited by the charge time, the given value is the optimal charge time but it varies greatly (+/- 10s) even at full power draw.

More details can be found on each weapon's page.

The weapon stats calculated in realtime (includes mods) can be seen with the [BuildInfo mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=514062285).

For modders: the numbers above might not match what you see in .sbc files because some are multiplied by the [weapon definition](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding/Reference/SBC/Weapon_Definition#DamageMultiplier "Modding/Reference/SBC/Weapon Definition") and there are [quirks with fire rate](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding/Reference/SBC/Weapon_Definition#MissileAmmoData.RateOfFire "Modding/Reference/SBC/Weapon Definition").

## Usage

### What's the difference between turret or static?

Each weapon block type is either a turret or static. All weapons can be aimed manually or AI controlled.

*   _Automatic turrets_ can turn and primarily use [AI](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Artificial_Intelligence "Category:Artificial Intelligence") to shoot at chosen targets. Secondarily, players can take manual aim control of them.
*   _Static Block Weapons_ are fixed and turn with the ship or [drone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automaton "Automaton") they are on. Secondarily, you can build [Custom Turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Custom_Turret_Controller "Custom Turret Controller") out of static weapons and aim them manually or use AI.

### How to configure manual shooting

When configuring Block Weapons in the [G-menu toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") of your cockpit, it makes a difference whether you use the entry from the **Block Weapons** filter or from the **All Blocks** filter!
