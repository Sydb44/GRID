The Assault Cannon Turret is a [weapon block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") for small and large grids, the automatic variant of the static [Assault Cannon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assault_Cannon "Assault Cannon").

## Usage

Assault Cannon Turrets are the slower and bigger siblings of the nimbler [Autocannon Turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Autocannon_Turret "Autocannon Turret"). It has a turret range of 800m and quite a wide maximum trajectory of 1400m. This turret uses [Assault Cannon Shell](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assault_Cannon_Shell "Assault Cannon Shell") ammunition.

A true multi-role weapon, designed with versatility in mind, the Assault Cannon Turret is equally well suited for close quarters and at range.

> _Delivering a powerful punch, the Assault Cannon Turret excels in its role as a primary weapon on smaller craft, and a secondary weapon on even the most massive vessel._

## Damage

*   4,000 [penetration damage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics#Penetration_Damage "Damage Mechanics").
*   [Ricochet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics#Ricochet "Damage Mechanics"): 85% chance from 0 to 20 degrees surface angle, then chance linearly scales to 25% until 50 degrees, past that angle it no longer ricochets.
    *   If it ricochets: 2,000 damage dealt to the hit block and subtracted from penetration damage.
*   Small-grid:
    *   Precision: 1.75m group at 100m (up to 0.5 degrees random offset from aiming line).
    *   10 RPM (fires one shot and then reloads for 6 seconds).
*   Large-grid:
    *   Precision: 1.22m group at 100m (up to 0.35 degrees random offset from aiming line).
    *   20 RPM (fires up to 2 shots at 180 RPM and then reloads for 6 seconds).
*   Round travels at 500m/s, vanishes after travelling 1,400m and it is affected by [natural gravity](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity "Gravity").
*   50 kN recoil force applied to ship.
*   The projectile is a missile type and because of that it can be targeted and destroyed by turrets having "Target Rockets" enabled.

## Turret

*   The Assault Cannon Turret can automatically aim and shoot at target types designated in its terminal, by default enemy ships.
*   It has a configurable detection range up to 600m for small-grid and 800m for large-grid version.
*   Can only target these types: Characters, SmallGrids, LargeGrids, Stations; of which can be Enemies or Neutrals.
*   The large-grid turret rotates at 22 degrees per second and is limited between -20 and 75 degrees elevation.
*   The small-grid turret rotates at 44 degrees per second and is limited between -10 and 50 degrees elevation.

## Construction

The small-grid version is a single heavy barrel turret of 7x5x7 blocks size, while the large-grid one is a heavy double-barreled turret of 3x2x3 blocks size.  
Both only mount on the bottom and have one conveyor [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") there as well.

## Power

The Assault Cannon Turret consumes 2 kW of power all the time while turned on. Firing or different ranges do not affect power usage.

## Inventory

Small-grid: 90L which corresponds to three [Assault Cannon Shells](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assault_Cannon_Shell "Assault Cannon Shell").  
Large-grid: 180L which corresponds to six [Assault Cannon Shells](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assault_Cannon_Shell "Assault Cannon Shell").  
Both have a conveyor port on the bottom therefore can be connected to a [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") to automatically pull ammo from containers.
