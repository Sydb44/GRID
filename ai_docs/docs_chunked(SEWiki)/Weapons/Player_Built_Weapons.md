# Player Built Weapons - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Player-Built Weapons (short: PBW), also known as Player-Made Weapons (short: PMW) or Player-Made Missiles etc., are any [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") that a player builds and uses to cause damage to grids and players, other than the standard explosives, [Character Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons"), or [Block Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons").

## Best Practices

There are no fixed rules how to design a PBW, experiment and do what works for you. The following are examples and best practices.

*   PBWs are purpose-built small grids with a gyroscope, small battery, and thrusters.
*   Most PBWs are AI-controlled and are sent out like guided missiles or torpedos.
*   Use [Merge blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block") or [Small Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Connector "Small Connector") to attach/detach them from the mothership.
*   Use [Timers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") to activate the stages.

Especially when you have multiple PBWs [3D printed](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer") from the same [blueprint](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") and connected to one mothership, using [timers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") is essential to group block actions, because [group names](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Groups "Groups") are not unique and will trigger _all_ docked PBWs.

## Some PBW Ideas

*   Your PBWs can have thrusters on override -- or be catapulted by a player-built mechanism (including [Artificial Mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Mass "Artificial Mass")+[Gravity Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator")).
*   Your PBWs can deliver [explosive payloads](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warhead "Warhead") -- or cause [kinetic impact damage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics "Damage Mechanics").
*   Your PBWs can be [remote controlled](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control"), [AI controlled](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence"), [script controlled](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripting "Scripting"), gravity controlled (free falling), or flying blind.
*   Your PBWs can be fast, cheap, and light-weight -- or tanky and protected with [Decoys](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decoy "Decoy") and [Heavy Armor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Heavy_Armor_Block "Heavy Armor Block").

If you design your PBWs to be cheap and without subgrids, you can mass-produce them using a [3D Printer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer").
