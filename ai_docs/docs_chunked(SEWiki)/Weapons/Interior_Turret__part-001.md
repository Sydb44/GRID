The  [![Icon Block Interior Turret.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Interior_Turret.png/21px-Icon_Block_Interior_Turret.png?a22e06)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Interior_Turret "Interior Turret") Interior Turret is a close-range [block weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") in Space Engineers. The  [![Icon Block Interior Turret.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Interior_Turret.png/21px-Icon_Block_Interior_Turret.png?a22e06)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Interior_Turret "Interior Turret") Interior Turret requires the same ammunition as the [MR-50A](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/MR-50A "MR-50A") (formerly [Automatic Rifle](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automatic_Rifle "Automatic Rifle")) or legacy [5.56x45mm NATO magazines](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/5.56x45mm_NATO_magazine "5.56x45mm NATO magazine").

## Usage

The  [![Icon Block Interior Turret.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Interior_Turret.png/21px-Icon_Block_Interior_Turret.png?a22e06)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Interior_Turret "Interior Turret") Interior Turret seeks out hostile targets within a 600m radius. It's a cheap good choice when you need to protect indoor large-grid areas from intruders without shooting through blocks at passing hostiles outside, as larger turrets sometimes do. Place it in difficult to see spots where it can defend a position against players or drones.

### How to load ammunition

Under the control panel is an area that looks like a long drawer handle, that's the inventory port. Interact with it by pressing [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and transfer ammunition from your character to the turret. Remember to refill it, without [conveyor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") port, this turret cannot draw ammunition automatically from your base or ship.

### How to target automatically

Open the [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") to configure the turret's automatic targetting behaviour. You can set it up to target:

*   characters including animals
*   small-grids vessels including drones
*   large-grid vessels, stations, [meteors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Meteor "Meteor"), and rockets. — Due to its low targeting range (600m) and weak damage, the  [![Icon Block Interior Turret.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Interior_Turret.png/21px-Icon_Block_Interior_Turret.png?a22e06)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Interior_Turret "Interior Turret") Interior Turret is not suitable for these cases.

By default, it fires upon hostiles and you can set it to target neutrals as well. As all automatic weapons, it will prioritize [Decoys](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decoy "Decoy").

## Damage

*   30 [impact damage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics "Damage Mechanics") to blocks; 20 damage to characters or 60 damage if hitting the character's head.
*   Precision: 0.35m group at 100m (up to 0.1 degrees random offset from aiming line).
*   Fires as long as it has ammo without any reload time.
*   600 RPM fire rate which is one of the highest fire rate weapons alongside the [Gatling Turret](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gatling_Turret "Gatling Turret") and the [Gatling Gun](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gatling_Gun "Gatling Gun").
*   Projectile travels at 300m/s, vanishes after travelling anywhere between 480m and 600m (randomly chosen per shot[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)) and it is affected by [natural gravity](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity "Gravity").

## Turret

*   The Interior Turret can automatically aim and shoot at target types designated in its terminal, by default enemy characters, enemy ships and meteors.
*   It has a configurable detection range up to 600m.
*   Can only target these types: Characters, SmallGrids, LargeGrids, Stations, Meteors, Rockets; of which can be Enemies or Neutrals.
*   The turret rotates very fast at 110 degrees per second and is limited between -76 and 90 degrees elevation.

## Inventory

Interior Turrets have an inventory with a volume of 384L (with Realistic [settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings")).  
It will only accept [MR-50A Magazines](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/MR-50A_Magazine "MR-50A Magazine"), or legacy [5.56x45mm NATO magazines](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/5.56x45mm_NATO_magazine "5.56x45mm NATO magazine"), of which it can hold up to 768 or 1919 respectively.

## Power

The Interior Turret consumes 2 kW of power all the time while turned on. Firing or different ranges do not affect power usage.

## Construction

If [progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is enabled, build a Basic Assembler first to unlock this block. It is much more affordable, lightweight, and compact than other turrets and easy to conceal.

This large-grid weapon has only one mount point at the bottom. It has **no conveyor ports**, so remember to keep its inventory [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") accessible and reload it manually.
