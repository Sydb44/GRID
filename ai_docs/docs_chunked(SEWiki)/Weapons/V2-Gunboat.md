V2-Gunboat can be spawned when a [SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") vessel is approached within 2km of the cargo vessel. This vessel is especially dangerous because of the large ship rocket launcher it has mounted.

Given their behavior, they have been given the game designation as drones. Unlike most drones, this one seems to come with a cockpit, and the AI maintains distance from the Engineer. This vessel is fairly well armed given its size, with maneuverability to match, and it may pulverize an unaware fighter craft.

The blueprint for this ship is also selectable as a picture on [LCD displays](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Panels "LCD Panels"), with blue outlines and some details lacking, but it is the same vessel.

[Original blueprint can be found here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=533968556).
