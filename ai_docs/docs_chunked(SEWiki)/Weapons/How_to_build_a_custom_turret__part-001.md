# How to build a custom turret

The  [![Icon Block Custom Turret Controller.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Custom_Turret_Controller.png/21px-Icon_Block_Custom_Turret_Controller.png?49af70)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Custom_Turret_Controller "Custom Turret Controller") [Custom Turret Controller](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Custom_Turret_Controller "Custom Turret Controller") (CTC) is a great block for building custom turrets, articulated mechanical "arms". Use it to control custom defense turrets, sun-tracking solar panels, drill arms, welder arms, grinder arms, or magplate cranes.

The CTC is easy to use and straightforward to set up; neither mods nor scripts are required; it works on PC and consoles and in single- and multiplayer. Either control the turret or arm manually, or use the game's built-in automatic AI ("artificially intelligent") targeting.

## Overview

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Trivial-custom-turret.png/320px-Trivial-custom-turret.png?638099)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Trivial-custom-turret.png)

A minimalist custom built turret with Battery, Cargo, Advanced Rotor, Hinge, Artillery, Camera. Not visible: the CTC.

The CTC block doesn't do anything by itself; it only makes sense when used together with other blocks, as described here. You must build your crane or turret out of blocks so that the "business end" can rotate left-right and tilt up-down. It's the same motion as your head on your neck (shaking your head and nodding), or as your hand on your wrist, turning and bending.

In Space Engineers, the blocks that perform these motions are [Rotors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") and [Hinges](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hinge "Hinge"), and they are essential parts of the custom turret. The simplest example is an [Advanced Rotor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Advanced_Rotor "Advanced Rotor") on the bottom, a Hinge on it, with a block weapon on top, and a Camera facing the same way as the weapon.

Whether you place the weapon upright or sideways on the hinge depends on where you want to aim:

*   On a rover or station, your priority is to also aim _down_ from your high ground to defend against ground attacks, so you attach the weapon orthogonally at a 90 degree angle.
*   On a spaceship in low gravity, your priority is to not shoot your own ship. Unlike a rover in gravity or a station, you can always turn the whole spaceship towards the attacker, so you attach the weapon block upright to get maximum range.
*   TODO: Describe solar panel

Putting a Hinge on a Rotor, and the weapon on rotor, is a good starting point because then the azimuth stays horizontal and the elevation stays vertical relative to the horizon, like your head, which makes it intuitive to control.

The game is not stopping you from putting a rotor on a hinge, or using two hinges, or two rotors! The mechanical blocks and the business end blocks don't even have to touch one another directly.  
Such turret variants also "work", but it makes turret control much less intuitive; these variants are not covered here. Depending on the purpose of your Custom Turret (e.g. a tall crane), feel free to experiment by yourself outside the tutorial.
