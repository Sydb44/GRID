# Encounter Abandoned Explorer - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The Abandoned Explorer can appear as a "Distress Signal" on your HUD. It's a crashed rusty (or icy) large grid ship that is still powered but it is not a dangerous encounter.

## Description

This is the wreck of large-grid exploration or possibly a mining support ship. It's propulsion was hybrid, atmospheric and hydrogen, and it even had a jump drive, which means it used to be made for long-distance travel. It had large cargo capacity and no turrets, which could be an indicator of civilan use. A [Dead Engineer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Dead_Engineer "Dead Engineer") carries a Data Pad with [Lore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lore "Lore") how he got here.

Even though a lot of blocks are broken and missing most components, the outline of the ship is still easy to see. If you have the components, it's a good candidate to be claimed and reconstructed over time. You can guess and replace missing blocks by the ship's symmetry. Many conveyor lines are disrupted and you will need to rebuild them for the cargo containers and hydrogen thrusters to work. If you choose reconstruction, make sure to dig it free of all ground voxel before you [convert it to a ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen").

Otherwise, you can loot it and salvage it for spare parts.

## Spoilers

This encounter has no active turrets and is well suited to be explored by beginners.

Tip: If you don't have certain DLCs, you could grind all the blocks around a DLC block, use a tug to lift the DLC block whole onto your ship, and [merge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block") it onto another ship.

### Loot

The wreck contains very valuable loot, including some DLC blocks, such as sci-fi thrusters. Many blocks are incomplete and missing most components.
