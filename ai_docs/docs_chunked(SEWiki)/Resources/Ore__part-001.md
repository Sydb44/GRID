# Category:Ores - Official Space Engineers Wiki

**Ores** are mined from [Asteroids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid") or [Planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets"), and are processed into [ingots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material") in one of the [Refineries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery"). Grids are made of blocks, blocks are made of components, components are made of materials, materials are made of ores. You mine ores from voxels using either a [ship-mounted drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drill "Drill") or [Hand Drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hand_Drill "Hand Drill"). Ores can also be looted from the cargo holds of some [pre-built ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Pre-Built_Ship "Category:Pre-Built Ship"), especially mining ships.

Use a  [![Icon Item Hand Drill.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Hand_Drill.png/21px-Icon_Item_Hand_Drill.png?3f75e3)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hand_Drill "Hand Drill") [Hand Drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hand_Drill "Hand Drill") or  [![Icon Block Ore Detector.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Ore_Detector.png/21px-Icon_Block_Ore_Detector.png?11609e)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ore_Detector "Ore Detector") [Ore Detector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ore_Detector "Ore Detector") to see ores close-by displayed on your HUD.

*   Hand drills only scan the topmost layers and miss most deposits.
*   Fly low in a small-grid ship with a small-grid Ore Detector to detect medium deep deposits.
*   Fly low in a large-grid ship with a large-grid Ore Detector to detect all deposits.

Remember to set the Ore Detectors to maximum range!

Ore patches on planets are generally visible from jetpacking height as groups of discolored spots on the ground.

*   Ore patches are best visible on plains, under ice and sand.
*   Ore patches are least visible on mountains or under snow or grass.
*   In space, use a camera and zoom in on asteroids.

If you don't find ores in one asteroid cluster, or in one planet region, travel a bit further: There are areas with nothing, the deposits have a fixed distribution. Ores also do not spawn close to [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts").

## How to plan a planetary mine

Planetary ore deposits appear in groups of two or three, and are spread out in horizontal layers below each other.

If you only detect the top deposit (or on asteroids, the outermost deposit), dig down to the first deposit and scan again 50 m or 150 m below.

*   Cobalt is often together with Iron and Nickel
*   Magnesium is often together with Nickel and Silicon
*   Gold is often together with Iron and Silver

### Vertical ore distribution

Certain ores are found more often in certain depth ranges:

### Horizontal ore distribution

Technically, ores are evenly distributed across the planets, but apart from the top deposit, they are out of range of the handdrill, so you easily miss them. [Screenshots of ore patches in different environments](https://imgur.io/a/4AdVtfj):

## How to mine ores

The handheld drill as well as the drill block both support two different dig modes, using [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\- and [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\- click.

1.  On foot, when drilling near your feet, first toggle [C key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to crouch to reach down.
2.  Equip the drill and **hold [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") to dig tunnels** through the grass and dirt layers to get closer to rock and ore deposits.  
    Careful, this mode destroys ores, ice, and stone!
3.  Equip the drill and **hold [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to mine ores**. Ores, ice, and stone drop as items.
4.  On foot, hold [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and aim at dropped ore chunks to pick them up into your [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory").
