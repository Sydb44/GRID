# Encounter Mining Outpost - Official Space Engineers Wiki

## Encounter Mining Outpost

The Mining Outpost is derelict station which can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is enabled in your world. It can be found by following the "[SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's HUD for 1s every minute, from a distance of 7-25 km. It can be found on the surface of an asteroid.

Engineers should aproach with great caution, as there are three Gatling mounts guarding the asteroid, and 2 Gatlings and 1 Interior Turret guarding the Mining Outpost. Also, an antenna that can summon Hostile Miner drones, which are miner drones that are equipped with two fixed Gatlings and a Rocket Launcher, is located there and switched on. These drones are capable of tracking a player within a 30 km radius (probably up to 50 km) and following him. Once they reach a distance of about 600 meters, the drone opens fire. The range of the drone's antenna is 2 km.

## Origin

This is what the main grid of the Encounter looks like without the asteroid.

Not much of the grid origin is known, as it was probably borrowed by Keen from the community, repainted and adapted to function as an encounter. Most likely the original Outpost was painted black, orange and blue. This is evident from the blocks of the second layer, which have retained their colours and have not been repainted. Many LCDs of the Outpost and one of the Programmable Blocks clearly indicate that the "Automatic LCDs 2" script by MMaster from Steam was used before. If you upload it to the Programmable Block, all LDCs will update their information and start working correctly.

The second Programmable Block probably contained a script to align the solar panels to the sun. However, after processing, the solar panels were fixed statically.

The first blueprints of the Outpost on Steam are dated March 2019.
