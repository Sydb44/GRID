## Conveyor system

Most of the ship is united into one massive conveyor system, but there are a few exceptions. The ship's Large Reactor is part of a smaller secondary conveyor network, also including two Small Cargo Containers and two Gatling Turrets. The ship's [Small Reactor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Reactor "Small Reactor") is not connected to the [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"). Three cargo containers in the aft cargo bay are also isolated, including the incomplete one.

Because both reactors are disconnected from the [Refineries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery"), this can cause problems refueling them. Additionally, the Gatling Turret on the ship's right side is attached to one of the incomplete [Large Cargo Containers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Cargo_Container "Large Cargo Container"), so it will be unable to reload very effectively unless the container is repaired.

## Capturing

**Spoiler warning!**

The mining hauler is well armed, sporting 4 gatling turrets and 2 missile turrets; 1 gatling and 1 missile on dorsal and ventral sides, plus a gatling on each side of the craft, with the ventral turrets also having clear line of fire across the front and rear of the ship. The gatlings will not open fire until you close within ~600m, the missiles within ~300-400m, as such one strategy is to match speed and heading with the hauler and pick off the point defenses from a safe distance. Another option is to eject junk materials towards the ship so that the turrets are distracted by your cloud of chaff, allowing you to park your ship in a blind spot on the hull, or move in closer for a better shot.

While the ship has 2 reactors, only the large reactor is fueled. A well placed missile to the relatively thin armor at the aft of the ship can easily destroy the reactor, cutting power to the ship's point defenses rendering it helpless while you hack the remaining systems before using the backup generator to restore power.

### Ingress

In the aft portion of the ship, on both port and starboard sides are a pair of sealed bay doors, which can be "popped" by cutting through an armor block in their top corner, this will cause the door to fall away, providing access to the interior landing bay. Alternatively, there is an exterior landing pad on the dorsal side of the ship with a door providing access to the cargo bay. There are interior turrets on the ceiling of both the cargo bay as well as the internal landing bay to be wary of.

Finally, the spotlight on the front of the bridge, as well as the catwalk panel just behind it (starboard side, dorsally located) provide weak spots that can be easily cut through to direct access the bridge.
