The Store is a block that enables trading as part of the [Economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") option.

If [Economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") is enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), Stores are found at [NPC-owned Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"). Players can build stores in their multiplayer bases, which can make sense especially if Economy is disabled.

## Usage

Players and NPCs use stores to sell or buy components, materials, tools, data pads, and even pre-built grids such as rovers or ships. Only NPCs can sell pre-built grids, and only players can buy them. The currency accepted in Stores is [space credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits").

You can also use the Store block to deposit and withdraw space credits, just like you can in an  [![Icon Block ATM.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_ATM.png/21px-Icon_Block_ATM.png?6f61fd)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/ATM "ATM") [ATM](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/ATM "ATM"). Keep this in mind in case you need to deposit space credit items but do not own the DLC required to build an ATM.

### How to buy and sell

Face the Store screen and [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click the display or press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). You see the tabs **Buy** and **Sell** (and possibly **Administration**) that list local offers and orders by the owner of this block.

*   You can only buy items if they are being offered _and_ you have enough space credits and inventory space.
*   You can only sell items if there is an order for them _and_ you have them in your inventory.
*   If you dock a ship at a conveyored connector, you can select a cargo container or tanks as source or target inventory.

### How to trade with players

To make your own offers and orders, build your own Store block in a safe location, for example, your faction base or space station. If you invite other players, it's your responsibility to protect the location with a [safe zone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone"), so that hostile players cannot dismantle it. If you own the Store block, or your faction has shared it with you, you can create offers and orders.

### How to offer to players

Only the [owner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") of the block can create sell orders. To make an offer, face the display and open the Vending Machine's **inventory** by pressing [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Make sure you have the items that you intend to sell in your inventory (components, materials, or consumables), and transfer them into the machine's inventory, then press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close it.

Next, [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click the display (or face it and press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")) and go to the **Administration** tab. Only the owner sees this tab.

To offer something for sale:

1.  Select **New Offer** on top.
2.  Select your item from the list.
3.  Enter the amount of items sold as one unit.
4.  Specify a sell price per unit -- or accept the default price. The block will impose additional listing fees and transaction fees for larger amounts of goods, which makes them non-competitive with [Economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts").

Click **Create** to create one or more offers, In this screen, you can also **Delete** selected existing offers.

Selling "a unit" means, for example, that you do not intend to sell individual steel plates, you want to sell them in batches of 100 plates = 1 unit.

Lastly, configure the block. Face the block and press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

*   In the [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel "Control Panel"), decide whether you want to choose "Anyone can use" to let non-allies trade as well. (Verify that they can reach the Store alive through your defences.)
*   Optionally, you can set up the LCD to any colour, scripts, free-form text, or images to be displayed; there is no Store script needed for the block to work, so you can even have it display a message to your customers, or the faction icon, etc.

### How to order from players

Only the owner of the block can create buy orders. [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click the display (or face it and press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")) and go to the **Administration** tab. Only the owner sees this tab.

To order an item that you want to buy:

1.  Select **New Order** on top.
2.  Select the item from the list.
3.  Enter the amount of items that you want to buy.
4.  Enter the price you are willing to pay. The block can impose additional listing fees and transaction fees for larger amounts of goods.

Click **Create** to create orders. In this screen you can also **Delete** selected existing orders.
