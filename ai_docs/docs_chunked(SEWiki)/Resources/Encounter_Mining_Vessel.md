The mining vessel before its crash

The **Mining Vessel** is a derelict ship which can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is enabled in your world. It can be found by following the "[SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") for 1s every minute, from a distance of ~25 km.

Engineers should aproach with great caution, as there are a few still active interior turrets mounted on the ships hull.

## The Original Ship

The original ship was buit by k\_medlock on steam, and was adopted by Keen as a random encounter, same as the [Encounter Corvette](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Encounter_Corvette "Encounter Corvette") and [Encounter Small Cargo Vessel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Encounter_Small_Cargo_Vessel "Encounter Small Cargo Vessel").

## Inventory

Loot: The small cargo containers next to the two dead engineers contain an Elite Welder and Grinder, plus some motors and construction components.

The cargo containers of the ship occasionally contain ores and ice, besides that, only components can be salvaged from the wreck.

It is possible to restore the ship, however it is a real challenge in survival mode. The ship contains multiple decorative DLC blocks, which will be visible, but cannot be used and will not provide components when destroyed if the player does not have the DLC installed.

## Trivia and Spoilers

[![Mining vessle log.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Mining_vessle_log.png/220px-Mining_vessle_log.png?158c61)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Mining_vessle_log.png)

The miningÂ vessel suffered a structural failure during a routine mining run. The pilots, Daniel A. Collins and Maurijn L. G. Lentz attempted to salvage the wreck and built two hydrogen engines, which constantly kept breaking down according to the log found on the ship. During their lunch break, a solar flare struck, causing an elecromagnetic impulse that drained the power from their suits. In their final moments, they were playing a game of Chess.
