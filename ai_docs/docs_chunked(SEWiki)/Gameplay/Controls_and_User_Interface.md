# Category:User Interface - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Depending on your choice you can play with keyboard and mouse or controller.

Controls:

*   [Key Bindings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") for mouse and keyboard
*   [PlayStation Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PlayStation_Controls "PlayStation Controls")
*   [Xbox Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Xbox_Controls "Xbox Controls")

There are several important windows that you will use during the game:

*   The [Terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal") contains, among other useful things, Control Panels and Inventory.
*   The [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") is where you wield tools and weapons, trigger ship actions, and select blocks while [building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building").

You should know how to read the [HUD (heads-up display)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"): It contains status information about you and your environment, "beamed" into your eyes by your trusty space helmet.

Additionally, the user interface highlights interactive [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") on blocks in yellow.
