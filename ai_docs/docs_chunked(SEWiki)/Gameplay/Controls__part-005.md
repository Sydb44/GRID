## Troubleshooting

### Why does this shortcut not work?

If a shortcut doesn't work as expected, ask yourself whether you are in the right context, for example:

*   Are you in [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") or [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode")?
*   Is the engineer standing, or seated in a Grid (that is, any [Cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") or seat), or using the [Terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal")?
*   Are you in [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode") (that is, a [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") slot is selected), holding a tool, or are you empty-handed (toolbar slot 0 is selected)? For example, outside of Block Placement Mode, the block rotation shortcuts are not active.
*   Did you enable [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode") for that world before you tried to use it?

And so on.

### Why can’t I look around or turn properly?

The **arrow keys** let you rotate the character when jetpacking, and pitch and yaw a flying ship.

*   Press ARROWUP key and ARROWDOWN key to look down at your shoes or up at the sky (pitch).
*   Press ARROWLEFT key and ARROWRIGHT key to turn left and right (yaw).

Often it is more intuitive however to use the mouse instead:

*   Move the **mouse** forward and backward to look up and down (pitch).
*   Move the **mouse** left and right (yaw).

This is called **mouse look**.

If turning a ship is too slow, typically, key bindings or your mouse are not to blame. In a ship, rotation speed depends on [Gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") mechanics, this means you need to build more (or stronger) Gyroscopes.

If turning feels "backwards" to you, press ESCAPE key and click **[Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options") -> Controls -> Controllers** and choose to **Invert the Y axis**.

If you’re in **F8 [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode")** and can hardly turn or move:

In **F7 Spectator Mode**, hold the ALT key to turn and move! In **F9 Static Spectator Mode**, you cannot move at all, that’s intended for recording video; press F6 key to return to your character.
