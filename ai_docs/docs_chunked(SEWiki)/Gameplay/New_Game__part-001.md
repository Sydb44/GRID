## First time on the Main Screen?

1.  Configure game-wide [Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options").
2.  Choose what your [character](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer") should [look like](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Screen "Character Screen").
3.  Optionally, click [Quick Start](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Quick_Start "Quick Start") to open a showcase world.

## How to create a New game

To create a new game, select a template:

1.  On the Main screen, click **New Game**.
2.  Select one of the following categories:
    *   [Sandbox](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game")
    *   [Story Scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Story_Scenarios "Story Scenarios")
    *   [PvP Scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PvP_Scenarios "PvP Scenarios")
    *   [Original Content](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content")
    *   [Community Content](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Community_Content "Community Content")
3.  Select one of the game templates.
4.  Optionally, click [Customize](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").  
    This is, among other things, where you choose [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") or [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"), [Multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") or Singleplayer, [modded](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods") or "vanilla".
5.  Click **Start**.

## What should I choose?

*   First time playing? Explore the [Quick Start](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Quick_Start "Quick Start") world to get an idea of the game.
*   [Story Scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Story_Scenarios "Story Scenarios") are recommended for everyone and they make a great starting point for beginners. Here you explore storylines and achieve goals.
*   [Sandbox Games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game") are recommended for intermediate and experienced players who set their own goals and set up custom worlds.
*   [PvP Scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PvP_Scenarios "PvP Scenarios") let you quickly spin up competive multiplayer worlds ready to race cars, have a shoot-out, or have a spaceship battle.
*   [Original Content](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content") contains legacy worlds that still work but that don't use all the most recent blocks.
*   [Community Content](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Community_Content "Community Content") is recommended for intermediate and experienced players because it can include [mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods").

## Scenarios on consoles

On consoles, only three scenarios are supported: The First Jump, Learning to Survive, Never Surrender. The official Lost Colony scenario does not work on consoles. Third-party scenarios from the Steam Workshops are not supported either on consoles. Console players can install the scenario on a [dedicated server (EOS)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Setting_up_a_Space_Engineers_Dedicated_Server "Setting up a Space Engineers Dedicated Server") and connect to the hosted PC game.

## Are there world size limits?

On PC, the ["infinite" world expands](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Star_System "Star System") as the player explores it.

In the default templates available on Xbox and Playstation, there's only three [planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") at a time, and the world is limited in sizeâ€”but practically, you will not notice any size limit during gameplay. Newer, faster consoles can handle more planets.
