# Access Panel - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The Access Panels are decorative blocks that look like animated lids. You can only build them if you have purchased the [Automatons Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automatons_Pack "Automatons Pack") DLC. They exist in four variants with different sizes to decorate ports, walls, and floors on large and small grids.
