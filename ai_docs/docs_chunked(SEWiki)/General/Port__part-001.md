# Port - Official Space Engineers Wiki

A port is the in-world user interface of a block. There are different types of ports with different uses.

## Terminal ports

Terminal ports look like small blue  [![Icon Block Control Panel.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Control_Panel.png/21px-Icon_Block_Control_Panel.png?e8d09a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel "Control Panel") [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel "Control Panel")s that are built into certain blocks.

Built-in terminals show a highlight when engineers face them. [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click them to quickly open this block's [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") in the [terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal").

You can move items through the conveyor system from the Inventory Terminal here, but you can't take them out into your player inventory.

## Inventory ports

An inventory port, also known as cargo hatch, gives you access to the block's [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") in the [terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal"). If the block is part of the [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"), you can also transfer items to other inventories (including your player inventory) from here.

Inventory ports look like yellow rectangles with two parallel bars in the middle. They show a highlight when engineers face them. You interact with them by [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-clicking or by pressing [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

All inventory ports are also conveyor ports!

 [![Icon Block Connector.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Connector.png/21px-Icon_Block_Connector.png?30a126)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") [Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector")s share some features with inventory and conveyor ports, but they are not conveyor ports.

On small-grid vehicles, it makes a difference whether you use large or small inventory ports -- see below.
