This screenshot feature is no longer maintained in Space Engineers. For the standard ways of taking [screenshots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Screenshots "Screenshots") see [Key Bindings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

## Legacy Usage

Ansel is a way to capture in-game screenshots and view them in 360 degrees. You can compose your screenshots from any position, adjust them with post-process filters, capture HDR images in high-fidelity formats, and share them in 360 degrees using your mobile phone, PC, or VR headset.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

Pressing [ALT+F2 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") in game opens the NVIDIA Ansel screen which allows you to prepare your shot, edit the styling, and choose the capture type. In offline singleplayer worlds, the game also pauses while the screen is open.

You need an NVIDIA GeForce graphics card to make use of this technology.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)
