SSGL is a abreviation for **s**mall **s**hip **g**one **l**arge.

In case you missed the UESC #37 contest, this rule refers to the SSGL (small ship gone large) passenger transport ship the #37 contest was about. SSGLs are bascially small block ships that are as big as those made of large blocks, which is very unusual as they often contain tens of thousands of blocks. The size limit of the #37 SSGL was not defined in blocks, but in the requirement that the ship had to fit inside a 12x9x17 bounding box, hence the 12x9x17.
