# Screenshots - Official Space Engineers Wiki

How to take screenshots of Space Engineers, and how to find them?

On PC, SE's built-in screenshot key [F4 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") saves a high-resolution picture of the game scree (including the HUD if visible) into the game's Screenshots folder at _"%APPDATA%\\Space Engineers\\Screenshots\\"_.

Depending on your Game Store, there may be additional shortcuts to take screenshots that are stored in different folders.

*   When using Steam, its screenshot key is [F12 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and you find the images through the Steam app.
*   Consoles use their standard screenshot button and they save all screenshots in a standard location.

There also used to be [Nvidia Ansel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Nvidia_Ansel "Nvidia Ansel") for highest quality screenshots.

Tip: Remember to cycle through the HUD detail modes by pressing [TAB key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") before taking the shot! This way you can choose whether you want to show or hide the HUD from the screenshot.
