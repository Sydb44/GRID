This All-Terrain-Vehicle (ATV) was designed with planets in mind. It is first seen as a projector hologram and can be welded from the hologram of the [EasyStation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EasyStation "EasyStation") base for a great fast ATV.

## Description

Since its original design, some blocks were altered, giving it a key flaw. That flaw being that the  [![Icon Block O2 H2 Generator.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_O2_H2_Generator.png/21px-Icon_Block_O2_H2_Generator.png?60936f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") [O2 H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") is not connected to the cockpit. The reason for this is because the number of small conveyor ports has changed from 3 to 2 for the small grid "Oxygen Generator". It is an easy enough fix for the ATV, but it requires cutting into the ship next to the cockpit and swapping a  [![Icon Block Small Conveyor Tube.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Small_Conveyor_Tube.png/21px-Icon_Block_Small_Conveyor_Tube.png?ef4a6f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Conveyor_Tube "Small Conveyor Tube") [Small Conveyor Tube](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Conveyor_Tube "Small Conveyor Tube") with a  [![Icon Block Conveyor Junction.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Conveyor_Junction.png/21px-Icon_Block_Conveyor_Junction.png?500970)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Junction "Conveyor Junction") [small conveyor junction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Junction "Conveyor Junction").

In the event that the Scuttler 'loses grip' and cannot traverse a steep slope loaded with ore or equipment, increase the power of the back wheels from 10% to 75%. This should solve most problems caused by mass. Be sure to reset the power when parked at base and set the battery to recharge. Remember as always, that the ATV's handbrake can be activated with [SPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). The Toolbar slot 1 showcases the use of a Timer block that toggles the handbrake and a red brake light on the back of the vehicle.

This ATV has two  [![Icon Block Connector.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Connector.png/21px-Icon_Block_Connector.png?30a126)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") [Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector"), one from the top and one behind. This allows the Scuttler to be used in tandem as a dump truck while the [Drill Ship Atmosphere mk.1](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drill_Ship_Atmosphere_mk.1 "Drill Ship Atmosphere mk.1") acts as an excavator. The  [![Icon Block Solar Panel.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Solar_Panel.png/21px-Icon_Block_Solar_Panel.png?ded806)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel") [Solar Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel") on top supplies the  [![Icon Block Battery.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Battery.png/21px-Icon_Block_Battery.png?fc3f6b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery") [Battery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery") with power and should be approached from above cautiously as the Drill Ship Atmosphere mk.1 is clumsy and drains power quickly.
