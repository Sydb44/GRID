## Usage

Windows are like one-way mirrors in that they are transparent when viewed from one side (the "inside"), but nearly opaque when viewed from the other (the "outside"). Because of their vast array of shapes and sizes, windows can be used to shape cockpits, ships, and stations more precisely than was possible before their release.

## Construction

Windows exist for small and large grid. Windows contribute to sealing airtight rooms depending on how they are rotated.
