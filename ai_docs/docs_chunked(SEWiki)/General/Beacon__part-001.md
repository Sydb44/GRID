A  [![Icon Block Beacon.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Beacon.png/21px-Icon_Block_Beacon.png?3a6e97)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Beacon "Beacon") Beacon is a [block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block") in Space Engineers that acts as a waypoint or navigation marker that appears as a visible [signal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal") on other players' [HUDs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"). The Round Beacon is a shape variant.

In contrast to the similar [antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna"), a beacon does not relay [remote access](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Access_Screen "Remote Access Screen") and uses much less power. In contrast to a static, private, zero power cost [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") marker, the Beacon can be attached to a mobile grid and is visible to anyone in range.

## Usage

*   Use Beacons to keep track of easily lost mobile grids, such as [Autopiloted](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Autopilot "Autopilot") drones.
*   [Jump Drives](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive") can use beacons as a jump target.
*   Used together with [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") or [Event Controllers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Event_Controller "Event Controller") that switch on a named beacon signal on your HUD under certain conditions, you can alert everyone in viewing range.

Secondarily, beacons also provide light, about 1.5 times as much as interior lights, but at a much larger construction cost.

### How to broadcast with beacons

By default, a beacon broadcasts your faction prefix and the word "beacon", e.g. "FCTN.Beacon".

To customise the text that Beacons display on the [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"):

1.  Enter the cockpit [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") of the ship or station the beacon is attached to.
2.  Open the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and select the beacon.
3.  Then type your desired name or message into the **HUD Text** field.

This text will be visible to anyone -- and will attract attention on PvP servers.

### Pros and cons

Beacons have the advantage that they can be placed on stations, large-grid ships, as well as small-grid craft. Leaving named beacons behind lets players publicly mark planetary and asteroid stations, resources, or keep track of mobile spacecraft or rovers on route.

The beacons' disadvantage is that they broadcast their signal to everyone in range, including enemies. Beacons have a logarithmic slider to adjust their maximum **Broadcast Radius** between 0 and 200,000 meters. All players within this range will see the beacon's name as a [signal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal") on their [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"), while only those beyond this radius will not.

## Power

The beacon draws a variable amount of power based on the distance it broadcasts, with no power drawn when it is off. For every 5km of **Broadcast Radius** added, the beacon will draw an additional kilowatt of power.

A beacon with a broadcast range of 5km will draw 1kW of power, whereas one with the default 20km range will draw 2kW of power. Power draw at 50,000 meters is 10kW, and eveb at 200,000 metres it's only 20kW.

## Construction

The Beacon exists for large and small grids and requires a 1x1x2 block space. It has mount points on its top and bottom faces, as well as the four smooth surfaces on the sides of its cubic lower half. The sides of the upper half (with the shining rings) do not attach to other blocks.

The Round Beacon is a shape variant with the same functionality, size, and cost. You can build it if you have purchased the [Decorative Pack 3](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack_3 "Decorative Pack 3"). The only difference is that the standard Beacon has a mount point on the top face and the Round Beacon doesn't.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

## Recipe

The Beacon and the Round Beacon have the same recipe.
