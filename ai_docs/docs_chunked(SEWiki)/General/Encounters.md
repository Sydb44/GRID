Encounters are interactive game content that you can enable in any world in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"). They spawn randomly in a radius around active engineers on suitable ground. You recognise them by their (neutral or hostile) signals that blink on and off.

Encounters provide exploration or combat gameplay, or both.

*   Challenges to be faced are traps, drones, and AI controlled turrets.
*   Some encounters contain valuable loot, others just provide harmless [lore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lore "Lore").

If you damage or attack an ship or building owned by an NPC faction, note that it will negatively affect your standing with them.
