*   Avoid punctuations and special characters (again, this is for linking sake).
*   Headings should not normally contain links, especially where only part of a heading is linked.
*   Headings should not explicitly refer to the subject of the article, or to higher-level headings, unless doing so is shorter or clearer.
*   Headings should be descriptive and in a consistent order.
*   Headings should be nested sequentially:
    *   the automatically generated top-level heading of a page is H1, which gives the article title;
    *   primary headings are then ==H2==, ===H3===, ====H4====, and so on until the lowest-level heading ======H6======.
    *   headings should be nested sequentially, neither using random heading levels (e.g. selected for emphasis, which is not the purpose of headings), nor skipping parts of the sequence.

### Table Styles

*   Small Tables (generally less than 20 cells)
    *   Float the table if it is narrow (one, two, or three narrow columns)
*   Large Tables (generally more than 20 cells)
    *   Avoid floating a large table as it may end up placing text in a vary narrow area beside the table.

_Note: Avoid tables that require a huge amount of space. If they are best for a set of information, use the CollapsibleBox template and default to the collapsed position. This will help keep articles shorter and help readers find information below the table they might otherwise miss._

### Warnings, Tips, Spoilers

Clean-up notices: [https://defaultloadout.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Ambox](https://defaultloadout.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Ambox)

To highlight a warning or tip, you can use a notebox:

*   {{Note|notetext=lorem ipsum.|type=note}}
*   {{Note|notetext=lorem ipsum.|type=info}}
*   {{Note|notetext=lorem ipsum.|type=warning}}
*   {{Note|notetext=lorem ipsum.|type=error}}

This is an example of what a highlighted tip could look like.

  
To warn readers of spoilers and let them choose whether they want to scroll further down or skip the rest of the page, use {{Spoiler}}, which renders as this banner:

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

  
To hide whole paragraphs or images containing spoilers, use: {{CollapsibleBox|title=Click to view spoiler|content=Clang Cola contains gravel!}}

### Keyboard, Mouse, Controler

Use the following templates to render keys or mousebuttons. [https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Mouse](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Mouse) [https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Key)

### Visual Media

*   Caption rules
*   Image Format: png preferred but jpg fine.
*   Use gifs only where they add more information than a screenshot would. Otherwise, avoid them.
*   Use videos as above, unless the video is a Keen official video. Use the <youtube></youtube> element to embed.
*   Qty of media on a page (use of galleries) _\- (try to keep the number low ish to keep page load time down)_
*   **Give credit to media creators / owners. This also includes workshop items. Avoid plagiarism at all times. If you are known to be plagiarizing, there will be consequences.**

### Player Suggestions

*   Personal player suggestions, tips, recommendations, strategies, and methods are generally discouraged on pages about the game proper.
    *   If you want to give tips on how to play the game, write a [tutorial](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tutorial "Tutorial").
*   This Wiki has been designed with game information and mechanics in mind. However, if you feel that an external guide or gameplay tip would be useful, please either:
    *   Link to the guide externally - for example, a guide to building an airlock on the [Air Vent](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Air_Vent "Air Vent") page. **Remember to credit the author**.
    *   Use the {{Spoiler}} template and place this information inside the spoiler tag.
*   Sources may include, but are not limited to: [The Space Engineers subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengineers/) , [Space Engineers Steam guides](https://steamcommunity.com/app/244850/guides/) , [Twitch clips or streams](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Space%20Engineers) or [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/).

## Categorization Rules

*   All Pages: Every page should be in a category. If a contributor does not know what category a page should go, it should remain uncategorized so that an admin can use the "uncategorized pages" tool to find it and place it in the appropriate category.
*   Lowest Relevant level only: do not place a page into all the categories in a nest. Only the lowest category that is appropriate is needed.
*   Max number of categories for a page (?): Do not place a page into lots of categories. If a page will fit into more than 3 categories, then it may need to be worked.
*   Creating a new category: In general, contributors should avoid making new categories. If a new category is appropriate, then the category page should be filled in with content. Categories should have more than 5 pages in them to be justified.
*   For more help with categories, see [Help:Category](http://community.wiki.gg/wiki/Help:Category)
