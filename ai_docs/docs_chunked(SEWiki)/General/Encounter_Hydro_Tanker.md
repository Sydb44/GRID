The Hydro Tanker debris in space

The Hydro Tanker is a derelict ship which can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is enabled in your world. It can be found by following the "[SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") for 1s every minute, from a distance of ~25 km.

## Description

The ship does not contain any regular notable cargo, just components from salvaging the wreck. The hydrogen can be stolen, two tanks are half full. By cutting the ship apart and hacking the connectors to pull it apart and expose the connector of the two usable tanks, a complete Large Hydrogen tank worth of fuel can be siphoned out.

The ship contains multiple decorative DLC blocks, which will not provide components if destroyed, if the player does not have the DLC installed. One dead engineer can be found on board.

It is possible to restore the ship in survival mode, for example, in a [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") start.

## Spoiler

Engineers should approach with great caution, as there are two still active Gatling turrets mounted on the ships hull.

## The Original Ship

Not much of the ship's origin is known, as it is probably Keen's own creation. It is intended to be a long distance hydrogen transport ship for the Space Pirates. Multiple repaired versions can be found on the Steam workshop.
