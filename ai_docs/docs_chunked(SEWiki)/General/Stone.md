the most common ore

Stone is the most basic raw material that can be mined from any planet, moon or asteroid by drilling the soil and rock they're made out of, and it is the most abundant resource per volume in the game.

When dropped into the world, Stone looks and behaves like an ore with the size and mass of a chunk representing the value of the resource contained. Drilling surface soil produces a lesser amount of Stone from the same volume compared to deeper rock. Asteroids and celestial bodies with no soil layer have uniform yield.

## Usage

Since the Survival Kit cannot process any actual ores, Stone serves as the initial source of basic materials until the first Basic Refinery is constructed.

After that, due to its very low yield of basic materials, regardless of the processing machinery used, Stone should only be considered in emergencies or specifically as source of Gravel for reactors.

## Yield

Mined Stone is processed best in [Survival kits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_kit "Survival kit") or standard [Refineries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery"), and less efficiently in [Basic Refineries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Basic_Refinery "Basic Refinery"). Stone processing separates it into [Iron Ingots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot"), [Nickel Ingots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Nickel_Ingot "Nickel Ingot"), [Silicon Wafers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Silicon_Wafer "Silicon Wafer"), and [Gravel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravel "Gravel").

In a Basic Refinery, 100 kg of stone produce only 3.53 kg of byproducts, thus a 3.53% weight ratio. Looking at the volume, 37 L of stone produce 0.77 L of byproducts. In contrast, a Survival Kit or standard Refinery gives you 30% more.

In Survival mode, freeing up inventory space is sometimes a greater need than the need for the byproducts, since volume is a greater annoyance than weight when managing one's inventory. Therefore, always refine drilled stone sooner than other ores to free up space. Use drag&drop to change the processing order in the [Inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") tab of the Refinery.
