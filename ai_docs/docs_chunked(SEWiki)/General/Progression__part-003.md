## What unlocks what?

Progression generally unlocks thematically related or dependent blocks, which makes it a bit easier to remember what unlocks what:

*   Algae Farm => Food production
*   Basic Refinery => Assembler, ore detectors, drills.
*   Basic Assembler => Assembler, batteries, lights, turrets, antenna, beacon.
*   Landing Gear => mobility blocks: wheel suspensions, cockpits, ion and atmo thrusters; also block tools and block weapons.
*   O2/H2 Generator => gas tanks, air vents, hydrogen engines, hydrogen thrusters.
*   Cargo Container => conveyors, sorters, connectors.
*   Power production blocks (solar panel, wind turbine) => mechanical blocks (hinges, rotors, pistons), merge blocks, beacons, doors.
*   Interior Block => all decorative and furniture blocks, including DLC.
*   Basic Assembler => light source => Automaton ([artificially intelligent](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence")) blocks.

## Trivia

If you are curious, the text files `ResearchBlocks.sbc` and `ResearchGroups.sbc` in the game files contain all the dependencies. The game files are under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\Content\Data`.
