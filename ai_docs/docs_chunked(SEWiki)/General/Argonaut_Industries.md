### Port Argos

The [Port Argos R&D Site](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1802590598) was the first AGI-developed colony on Mars. It eventually became the Sol system's primary Vehicle R&D site where Argonaut Industries Engineering Division prototypes, tests, and manufactures their high-quality vehicles.

### Rust Point Colony

The [Rust Point Colony](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2565050991) used to be a small gray mining settlement located in the middle of nowhere (that is, [Pertam](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pertam "Pertam")) until Argonaut Industries transformed it into an industrial site. After the Uranium mine there shut down, the Colony became a component manufacturing site. Local scrappers provide wrecks to be recycled into components which are shipped off-world and sold as premium components.
