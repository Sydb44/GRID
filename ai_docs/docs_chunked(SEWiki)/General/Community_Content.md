The [Workshops](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Workshop "Workshop") contain a wide array of challenging community-created scenarios, worlds to explore, puzzles to solve, and battles to fight.

The option to create a [New Game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_Game "New Game") based on community contributed scenarios is recommended for intermediate to advanced players. Scenarios with modifications and new rules introduce extra challenges for beginners, but may provide interesting variations for experienced players.
