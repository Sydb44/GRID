The Pirate Raider (side view)

The Pirate Raider is a large grid attack ship that can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is enabled in your world, when you follow a "SPRT Pirate Raider" beacon signal. It belongs to the "[Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates")"Â faction.

## Description

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

  
In contrast to many others, this random encounter is not a derelict wreck. This ship is mobile and, after receiving damage, will attack the engineer and fly around the player at full speed. It is possible however to catch up to it using the jetpack.

## Defences

Engineers should approach with great caution, as the ship has numerous guns that will defend it.

The ship can also summon SPRT Raider drones. These drones are capable of tracking a player within a 30 km radius (probably up to 50 km) and following him. The range of the drone's antenna is very short (about 2 km). They are armed with a gatling turret, a pair of fixed gatlings and a rocket launcher.

## Origin

[The original build](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=775925899) is by Bruce LeedleLeedleLeedleLee on Steam, and the build was adopted into the world by Keen as a random encounter. Originally it is minelayer with a refinery and an assembler for mine production.

## Contents

The only cargo the ship carries is missile tubes and ammunition. Besides that, the parts can be salvaged for components if needed. The ship contains multiple decorative DLC blocks, which will be visible, but will not provide components if destroyed if the player does not have the DLC installed.
