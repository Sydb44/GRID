stores notes and GPS coordinates

**Datapads** are craftable items used to store free-form text and GPS coordinates in game. You can store 1000 letters worth of info in a datapad. Datapads are often found in  [![Icon Block Bed.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Bed.png/21px-Icon_Block_Bed.png?d29901)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Bed "Bed") [Bed](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Bed "Bed")s.

## Where can I find them?

Prewritten datapads can often be found in game.

### Datapads and Economy

When [Economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") is enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), one free Economy Datapad is always found among the starter equipment in the seat of respawn [Drop Pods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pods "Drop Pods").

Economy Datapads are datapads that contain prewritten text, similar to letters or advertisements written by NPCs. They are for sale in NPC [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"). Read them to obtain coordinates of random NPC-owned trade stations.

### Datapads and Lore

When [Planetary Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planetary_Encounters "Planetary Encounters") and [Global Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Global_Encounters "Global Encounters") are enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), you can find prewritten Datapads as part of the loot. They contain snippets of [lore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lore "Lore"), unseen NPCs' incidental letters and notes, the last words of a shipwrecked crew member, the last log entry of the captain right before desaster strikes. They make the space feel more alive.

## Usage

Players use datapads as in-game items to keep and share notes, messages, and GPS coordinates.

After you have crafted or bought a Datapad, put it in your player inventory and [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click the datapad to read or write it.

### How to write a datapad

To edit the text in the datapad:

1.  In your inventory, [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click the datapad to open it.
2.  Optionally, enter a Datapad name in the first field.
3.  Type your text in the larger field.

You can write normal text and also paste one or more GPS coordinates in Space Engineers' own format. For details, see [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS").

### How to store GPS coordinates

To add GPS coordinates to the message:

1.  Go to your [GPS screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS").
2.  Click the **copy the GPS** button and press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the window.
3.  In your inventory, [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click the datapad to open it.
4.  Place the caret into the text field and press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to paste the GPS coordinates into the text.

Repeat this to store several coordinates in one Datapad, each GPS coordinate on one line by itself.

### How to receive GPS coordinates

You have received a datapad and want to see where the mentioned GPS coordinates are in your world.

1.  [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click the datapad in your inventory.
2.  Click the **Create GPS Marker** button.  
    The GPS is _temporarily_ added in grey to your GPS list.
3.  Press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the datapad.
4.  Open the [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") screen.
5.  Scroll to the new gray GPS name, select it, and enable the checkbox that says **Show On [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD")**.

This stores the coordinate permanently, even if you lose the Datapad.

Note that not all datapads found in the world will contain GPS coordinates. The **Create GPS Marker** button will still be present, but will do nothing. If a datapad contains a GPS coordinate, it will show the GPS coordinate within the Content box. They look similar like this:

GPS:SCSR - Station:78288.4641423225:101236.08618027:5737106.67996554:#FF75C9F1:

Activate **Show On HUD** immediately after creating the GPS marker, otherwise the entry disappears from your GPS list again.

## Port size

On small [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid"), Datapads fit through small [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port").

## Assembly

Datapads are cheap to craft in any [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit")'s or (Basic) [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler")'s **Equipment** tab.
