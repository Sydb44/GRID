"_Every body persists in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed._" — [Newton's first law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_first_law)

"_An object that is at rest will stay at rest unless an external force acts upon it._" — [Newton's first law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_first_law)

"_An object that is in motion will not change its velocity unless an external force acts upon it._" — [Newton's first law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_first_law)

### 63

"_The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to, and in the same direction as, the net force acting on the body, and inversely proportional to its mass._" — [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_second_law)

### 64

"_To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction: or the forces of two bodies on each other are always equal and are directed in opposite directions._" — [Newton's third law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_third_law)
