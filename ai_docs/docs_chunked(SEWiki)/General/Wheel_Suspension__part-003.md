*   **Allow Parking Brake On/Off** -- Whether pressing [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") engages the handbrake and other docking actions (see [Cockpit Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls")).

*   **Invert Steering on/off** -- Enable this only on the wheels on the right side while activating Steer Override.

### Can the Autopilot drive cars?

Wheeled vehicles cannot properly use the [Autopilot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Autopilot "Autopilot") function as spaceships do, because the Autopilot doesn't turn or propel the wheels. As a workaround, you will have to set up **Propulsion Overrides** to force the vehicle into a sort of waypoint-guided cruise control.

For details, see [How to use autopilot with wheeled vehicles](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/How_to_use_autopilot_with_wheeled_vehicles "How to use autopilot with wheeled vehicles").

The [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control")'s [Autopilot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Autopilot "Autopilot") may not be able to control wheels -- but a player can still remote-control a wheeled vehicle manually.

## Construction

The two variants of suspension blocks labeled "right" or "left" only matter for cosmetic purposes. Any wheels will correctly move in the direction of the Remote Control block / Main Cockpit of a vehicle.

  
Suspensions only attach to grids on the flat side that's opposite the shoe (the place where the wheel meets the suspension). Choose a well spaced attachment point on the grid. The wheel tyre will need clearance to the grid and the ground to fit unobstructed.

When attaching wheel suspensions, it is essential to know which side is up. [Rotate](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode#How_to_rotate_blocks "Block Placement Mode") the suspension block ghost until the shoe faces outwards and the "J" shaped frame is on the bottom side, and the elbow piston-looking "shock absorber" is the top of the suspension.

After placing a suspension on a grid, if there is enough space, the wheel tyre is automatically added at its end. Both Wheel and Suspension must be welded separately to construct a functional wheel.

If no wheel tyre appears, make sure there is enough space, then click **Add Wheel** in the control panel to restore the missing tyre.

Tips:

*   Additionally adding [Gyroscopes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") to a vehicle enables intuitive turning and levelling (Yaw and Pitch) by moving the mouse.
*   Multiple double-layered small wheels have more gripping strength than one big 5x5 wheel suspension; but smaller wheels are slower and their suspensions bottom out much more easily.
*   Wheeled constructions that work well in singleplayer need to be tested and tuned again for (laggy) multiplayer.
