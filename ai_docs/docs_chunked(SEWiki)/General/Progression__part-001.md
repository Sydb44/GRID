# Progression - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Progression is an optional game mechanic for players in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"). It restricts which functional blocks you have access to build from the [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar"), which has pros and cons that affect the early stages of a game.

Progression is enabled by default when you create a new Survival Mode game. You can disable it in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") if desired.

## How Does Progression Work?

With Progression enabled, blocks that are considered decorational, intermediate, or advanced are unavailable from the [Toolbar Configuration](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar_Configuration "Toolbar Configuration") at the start. You cannot build, weld, repair, or [hack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking") certain blocks until you unlock them by manually welding up specific preliminary blocks first. Some blocks can be unlocked in several ways.

You do not have to keep or use the welded preliminary block, but you can. For example, you can weld up a Gravity Generator to unlock the Jump Drive, and immediately grind down the Gravity Generator again to reuse its components to build the Jump Drive.

Without Progression, engineers can place, weld, repair, hack any block from the [Toolbar Configuration](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar_Configuration "Toolbar Configuration") that they have the materials (and paid DLC) for.

### Progression Example

[![An example of progression: How to unlock hydrogen thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Progression-example.png/259px-Progression-example.png?9b3b1f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Progression-example.png)

The yellow path shows how to unlock hydrogen thrusters: 0. search for the block name, 1. build o2/h2 generator, 2. build any tank, 3. build thrusters. (Colours enhanced for emphasis.)

Example: Your droppod landed next to ice and you want to build hydrogen thrusters early on, but you can't find the hydrogen thrusters on the **Blocks** tab of the toolbar config. You want to find out how to unlock them.

1.  Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and switch to the **Progression** tab.
2.  Search for "Hydrogen Thruster", and you see its icon highlighted in green in a row.
3.  From the thruster icon’s row, go backwards: Follow the line to the left and then up.  
    You arrive at a row with large and small "Hydrogen Tanks". You know you have not yet built any tanks.
4.  Again, follow the line from the tanks row to the left and up.  
    You see a row with an "O2/H2 Generator". This is your level-1 entry point.

Now you know how to progress, from the top left down to the right:

1.  Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and stay on the **Blocks** tab.
2.  Search for the following blocks and drag them to your [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar"):
    1.  [Build](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") an O2/H2 Generator to unlock the row of Hydrogen Tanks.
    2.  Build one of the Hydrogen Tanks to unlock the row of Hydrogen Thrusters.
    3.  Build Hydrogen Thrusters.

### What are the advantages of Progression?

Beginners are overwhelmed by the amount of blocks in the configuration menu — especially the armor shape variants and decorative blocks are a huge distraction early on. By restricting the available blocks to a minimal, functional set, beginners can focus on learning the important functional blocks first, which makes the learning curve less steep.

For example, beginners might attempt to build hydrogen thrusters without understanding that they will also need to 1) produce hydrogen, and 2) store it. The Progression tree forces them to build 1) an O2/H2 generator and 2) a hydrogen tank first, prompting them to use these required blocks in their build, helping them to not forget the prerequisites.

### What are the disadvantages of Progression?

More experienced players feel artificially restricted by Progression, especially in what they can do right at the start.

For example, experienced players may choose a [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") scenario, or a piracy/salvage-only scenario, where they raid passing cargo ships and take them over. With Progression on, they are now forced to follow an arbitrarily imposed order in which they are ”allowed” to [take ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking") of stolen blocks —— because they must have unlocked the blocks to be able to weld them up to gain ownership.

Also, experienced players know the prerequisites of blocks and likely already have a plan in mind how to fulfil them, which is not necessarily following the book. They don't need the progression's guidance.

Thirdly, some imposed dependencies are quite arbitrary: Why do block weapons depend on landing gear, what if I'm starting in a base? Why do air vents depend on O2/H2 Generators, what if I need to urgently suck oxygen from a thin planetary atmosphere into my cockpit for survival? Why do I need to build a tiny small-grid cargo container to be allowed to repair my Connector to recharge my large-grid ship?

## Can I repair a block placed by someone else?

If progression is on, the building restrictions are per player and per game.

If you encounter a block placed by NPCs or other players:

*   You can use only it if the [owners](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") give you or your faction permission.
*   You can always grind it down.
*   But you can only weld it back up if you have the block unlocked. (DLC ownership is another factor.)

This limitation has an impact on how you can approach early-game repairs, piracy, and salvaging, because you might not be able to hack or repair any late-game blocks on pirated ships yet.
