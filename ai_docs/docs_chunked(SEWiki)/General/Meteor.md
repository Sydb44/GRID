Meteorites glowing in the atmosphere before striking a planet.

Meteors are an optional hazard introduced with [Update 01.024](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Version/01.024 "Version/01.024") and updated in 1.207. You can set the frequency and severity of meteor showers under **Environment Hostility** in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

*   Safe: Meteors will never spawn.
*   Normal: Meteors will occasionally spawn in small numbers.
*   Cataclysm: Meteors will spawn more often and in greater numbers.
*   Armageddon: Meteors fall continuously, with "unrealistic" frequency.

Tip: [Weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather") is a separate setting from meteors and can be found under **Weather System**.

## mechanics

*   Meteors can appear in space and on planets and moons
*   Meteors burn up in the atmosphere of Earthlike and do not reach the ground
*   Meteors spawn near players but are not aimed at players or grids
*   Meteors leave no crater or voxel deformation and leave no mineable ores
*   Meteors can damage grids and players (but it's rare)

## Defenses

Meteors spawn on the side of the sector nearest the sun and sweep across the map. Positioning ships and stations on the dark side of the natural asteroids therefor shields them from any meteor strikes. This shielding comes at the cost of complicating the use of [Solar Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel"), since a direct line to the sun would expose the panels to the risk of being struck. Consider foldable solar panels with sensors.

All automated turrets such as [Gatling](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gatling_Turret "Gatling Turret"), [Interior](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Interior_Turret "Interior Turret"), and [Rocket Turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket_Turret "Rocket Turret") can be set to automatically target and attempt to shoot down meteors.

*   [Rockets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") are most effective but also most expensive.
*   [Gatling Ammo Boxes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gatling_Ammo_Box "Gatling Ammo Box") are cheaper ammo.
*   The range of the Interior Turret is practically too low to be of any use against meteors.

Meteors are easier to see on planets with atmospheres because they burn, in space they only leave a subtle trail and are easily overlooked.

## Trivia

Before 1.207, Meteors used to be aimed around players. When meteors struck an asteroid or planet, a crater used to appear and a small amount of random ores would generate in the crater that you could mine. The crater itself looked like stone but dropped no stone when mined. Impacting meteor damaged grids and deformed planetary and asteroid voxels. The craters presented additional challenges to the player while driving on planets. Over time, the voxel deformations used to slow down the game world and needed to be [reset](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") to restore performance.
