Encounter spotted through the camera zoom

The Skyheart is derelict ship which can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is enabled in your world. You can find it by following the "SPRT MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") for 1s every 5 minutes. It does not contain much loot, but it is a great find in an emergency or during a [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") start.

Beware, it sometimes turns hostile.

## Loot

This shattered wreck used to be a small, fast, blue shuttle with a glass cockpit for one pilot. The shuttle could navigate in space using Ion thrusters and on planets using hydrogen thrusters, many of which are damaged. It is lightly armed with a Missile Launcher and an interior turret. Since it is an encounter, it is a static grid that cannot turn its static rocket launcher towards you.

This encounter could be valuable during a [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") start, or if you are stranded, because it contains essential Life Support equipment: A (sideways?) Survival Kit, a Hydrogen Engine, and an O2/H2 Generator (which can contain ice).

The ship's cargo was likely already plundered and contains only a few tools, bottles, and ammo. Again, good emergency loot if you find yourself having no ship nor equipment.

Encounter Skyheart and drone

There are two variants of this encounter. If the signal turns into "[Hostile Signal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/How_to_trigger_Pirate_Encounters_on_any_map "How to trigger Pirate Encounters on any map")", you know the pirates are using this wreck as bait to lure in victims like you. Also, if you see a dead pilot inside, then you know you are in the hostile variant and drones will be closing in soon. Be prepared to be attacked by one or more Red Drone MK1s, Salvage Drones, or even [V2 Gunboats](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/V2-Gunboat "V2-Gunboat"), which are not to be trifled with.
