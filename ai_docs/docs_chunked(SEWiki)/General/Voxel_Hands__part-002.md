Voxel Hand shapes in the toolbar, with Box shape selected, and gold material selected.

When you now click in mid air, you can place voxels in their pure shape ("box" shaped for example). Or if you click existing voxels, their shape will merge organically and adjust to the existing voxel.

## Remove Voxels

To delete voxels, select a Voxel Hand shape and hold [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right"). It works more reliably when you don't stand too close. Or use a [drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drill "Drill"), as you do in Survival Mode.

## Replace Voxels (Paint)

Instead of adding or removing Voxels, you can also replace their material without changing the shape. Similar to painting blocks, select a material and shape first, and then [![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-click to change voxel materials.

For example, after you have shaped a wilderness trail, you paint its surface a more worn out colour, or you paint a road gray. A scenario designer or server admin could paint a boulder "gold" to add ores to locations for gameplay or story reasons.

## Reset Voxels

Resetting voxels can be beneficial for performance if you have many craters and tunnels that you no longer need. Resetting is better than manual refilling, performance-wise.

To reset voxels, select a Voxel Hand shape, make it very large, hold [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and then drag the right mouse button.

Alternatively, the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") also offers a way of cleaning up voxel changes.

## Best practices and limitation

*   You can only place voxels inside an existing asteroid's or planet's bounding box.
*   Remember you can change the dimensions and alignment of the tool, for example, it can be flat or long, big or small.
*   Save often by pressing [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[F5 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), then you can "undo" by pressing [F5 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
*   Remember to use [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode") instead of [jetpacking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack").
*   Rotate the voxel hand shapes with the same keys as blocks when [building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building"), which is an interesting design option when using ramp and capsule shapes.
*   Use [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-scroll to change the distance between your view and the tool.
*   Consider whether you want the new terrain to snap to the voxelgrid or whether it's better to disable the grid constraints.
*   It's easier to first make a hole or trench, and then fill it smoothly, instead of attempting to paint smooth voxel on top of uneven existing voxels.
