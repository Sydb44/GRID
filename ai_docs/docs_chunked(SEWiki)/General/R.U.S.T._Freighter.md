# R.U.S.T. Freighter - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The R.U.S.T. Freighter is a kind of heavy hauler without jump drives designed to drift for long periods of time. It can spawn if the "Cargo ships" option is enabled in your [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"). The ship was built by Aragath, a Keen employee.

## How to take it over (Spoilers)

While it is lightly armed, it is advised to not stalk behind the Freighter as it will release decoys and full throttle away once it senses an Engineer nearby. 

It is however possible to catch up to it via jetpack, as jetpacking speed is 10m/s faster than that of the freighter. Be cautious of the two gatling turrets at the back and the two interior turrets, one on the nose and one inside the passenger area, sideways under the cryopod.

After taking command of the flight seat, turning on the dampeners will not be enough to stop the ship, as after sensing the engineer, the rear thrusters are locked in maximum forward thrust overdrive. To bypass this, remove the "thrusters" group from the terminal, and assign all the hidden blocks to you own faction. Another option is to completely destroy and rebuild the rear thrusters one by one. There are no traps on this ship.
