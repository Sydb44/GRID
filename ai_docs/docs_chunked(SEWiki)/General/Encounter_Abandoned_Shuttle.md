The Encounter Abandoned Shuttle can appear as a "Distress Signal" on your HUD. This [Panetary Encounter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planetary_Encounters "Planetary Encounters") is a medium-sized crashed (rusty or icy) large-grid ship that is still powered. It is not dangerous to players, and it contains minor loot.

## Spoilers

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

  
This crashed ship was a shuttle that has been abandoned. You can still see the outline of the hull and what the interior used to be, though many blocks are missing or worn down by weather and non-functional. You find the body of an engineer with a [lore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lore "Lore") message.

It may be not worth it to repair it, but you can grind down all thrusters and build a space-faring hybrid ship out of it.

## Blocks

If you don't have the DLCs, you can cut around the DLC blocks and tug them and merge them onto your ship.

## Loot

*   very few components, drinks
*   cargo container with some ores
*   some tools or weapons
*   dead engineer data pad with lore
