**Space Engineers - Heavy Industry**[\[1\]](#cite_note-website-1)[\[2\]](#cite_note-steam-2) also known as the **Heavy Industry Pack**[\[3\]](#cite_note-marek-3)[\[4\]](#cite_note-update-4) or **Heavy Industry DLC**[\[3\]](#cite_note-marek-3) is a [DLC](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:DLC "Category:DLC") for Space Engineers. It was added in update 1.199, which was also titled "Heavy Industry."[\[4\]](#cite_note-update-4)

In the build menu, its blocks can be found in the _Industrial Blocks_ group.

## Usage Without Owning the DLC

Note that despite being a DLC, it doesn't actually download anything as all of its content is included in the base game, just made inaccessible. This allows players without the DLC to still see blocks and armor skins from it if they play on multiplayer servers with players who do have it, and play on [downloaded worlds](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") that include those blocks.
