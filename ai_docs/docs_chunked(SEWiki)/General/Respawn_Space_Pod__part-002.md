Mirroring the situation of players who start on a planet and build a space-faring ship, players who start in space proceed to build a planetary lander.

*   In multiplayer, the pod is by default temporary and disappears after you log out, or after you respawn in a new pod.

*   In single-player, the pod does not despawn by default; you can configure the pod's despawn behaviour in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

Follow the general advice for [how to convert the Drop Pod to a starter base](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pod "Drop Pod") before you log out.

Gather ice to keep the life support system running. If running out of ice, save oxygen by switching on and off the Air Vent manually, and pressurising the cockpit only when the door is closed. See also [Airtightness](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") for related advice.

The space pod does not have an [Ore Detector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ore_Detector "Ore Detector"), so either build one (loot parts from [Unknown Signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unknown_Signals "Unknown Signals")), or spacewalk and use your [Hand Drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hand_Drill "Hand Drill") to find resources on asteroids.

It is also quite slow since it lacks a [Jump Drive](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive"). The ship is best suitable to visit [NPC Space Stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") and asteroids and the Moon.

## Trivia

The space pod has been introduced in the major Space Engineers Release of February 28, 2019 that brought the game out of Early Access.

Judging by the blue colour scheme, these emergency pods are possibly produced by the [Sol Cooperative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative") faction.
