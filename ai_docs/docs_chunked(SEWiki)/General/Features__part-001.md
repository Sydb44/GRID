Space Engineers uses the in-house built [VRAGE 2.0](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/VRage "VRage"), a realistic volumetric-based physics engine: All objects can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed.

## Overview

*   Planets and moons – fully destructible & persistent, volumetric, atmosphere, gravity, climate zones, no orbital mechanics
*   Game modes
    *   [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") – unlimited resources, instant building, no death
    *   [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") – realistic management of resources and inventory capacity; manual building; death/respawn
    *   Singleplayer – you are the sole space engineer in creative or survival mode
    *   [Multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer")
        *   Creative or survival mode with your friends
        *   Cooperative or competitive, safe zones, factions
        *   Privacy customization: offline, private, friends only, public
        *   4-32 players (depending on platform)
        *   Dedicated servers
*   New game options
    *   [Scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") - some offer a linear story with action-packed gameplay, while the majority of Space Engineers scenarios feature unique sandbox environments where players create their own challenges.
    *   [Sandbox Games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game") - offer variety of customizable worlds where you can start your own scenario.
    *   [Community content](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Community_Content "Community Content") - offers worlds created by other players and shared on the workshop.
*   Customizable [character](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Screen "Character Screen") - one male and one female character, suit skins and colors, mods, Steam community marketplace
*   [Building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") in creative or survival mode - build and pilot wheeled vehicles, ships, and mechs; build space stations, planetary bases, outposts, cities; walk in ship interiors and on the outer hull (magnetic boots)
*   First-person and third-person view
*   Super-large worlds – the size of the world to 1,000,000,000 km in diameter (almost infinite)
*   Procedural asteroids - an infinite number of mineable asteroids in space
*   [Exploration content](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Encounters "Encounters") - adds countless NPC ships, stations, and wrecks to the game world; fight, explore, capture, or salvage!
*   Ore and ice mining - use drills to dig for resources in survival mode
*   Manual building in survival mode – use welders to assemble blocks from components; use grinders to disassemble and reuse components
*   Deformable and destructible objects – real proportions, mass, storage capacity, velocity, integrity
*   Building [blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blocks "Blocks") - gravity generators, jump drives, turrets, doors, windows, magnetic landing gears, factories, rotors, hinges, pistons, wheels, thrusters, wind turbines, solar panels, decorations, and many more!
*   [Electricity](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power") – all blocks in a grid are implicitly wired in an electrical and computer network; electricity is generated by nuclear reactors or various renewable power sources
*   [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") - use pipes to connect containers and tanks, load and unload ships at stations using connectors, collectors, sorters, ejectors
*   [Gravity](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") – produced by planets and by gravity generators in space
*   [Symmetry](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry")/Mirror mode – useful in creative mode when building structures that require symmetry
*   [Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") – handguns, rifles, explosives, warheads, ship turrets, artillery, missile launchers, railguns, and more. No laserguns.
*   [Workshops](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Workshop "Workshop") – share your creations with the Community: upload and download worlds, ship blueprints, mods, scripts
*   Localized interface
    *   Official localization: English, Russian, Chinese, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese-Brazil
    *   Community localization: Czech, Danish, Dutch, German, Icelandic, Polish, Spanish-Spain, Spanish-Latin America, Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Norwegian, Swedish, Slovak, Ukrainian
*   Cargo ships - auto-piloted NPC vessels (miners, freighters, and military) that carry valuable goods from sector to sector. Capture and loot them, but beware, they can defend themselves!
*   Oxygen - life support, take off the character's helmet, generate oxygen out of ice by using the O2/H2 generator
*   Hydrogen - fuel for hydrogen thrusters and jetpack, hydrogen tanks, hydrogen bottles
*   Factions - create and join factions, determine ownership of blocks and manage the relations between them (hostile/ally).
*   [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") – control drones, ships, and turrets without being inside
*   [Artificial Intelligence](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence") - set up simple drone behavior (follow, intercept, circle, patrol, collision avoidance, attack, defend)
*   [Modding](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding "Modding") - share custom world files, shaders, textures, 3D models
*   [Modding API](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding "Modding") - brings a lot of new possibilities to modders and allows them to alter the game by writing C# scripts which have access to in-game objects
*   [Blueprints](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") - save your ship or station as a blueprint and paste it into your game
*   [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") - create, send, receive and manage waypoints in the game
