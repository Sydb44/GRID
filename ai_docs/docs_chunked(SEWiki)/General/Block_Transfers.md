# Block Transfers - Official Space Engineers Wiki

On the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"), when someone changes [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") of a ship or station to you, you can accept or decline the transfer.

You find the **Block Transfers** button in the [Terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal") (press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")).

The dialog tells you the number of blocks and the name of the grid being transferred to you â€” if any. The decision is important, because when you accept a grid, the blocks use up _your_ [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU") budget, this means you cannot accept unlimited amounts of grids.
