## Which Armor Skin Comes From Which DLC?

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Which-skin-is-from-which-dlc.png/300px-Which-skin-is-from-which-dlc.png?12f764)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Which-skin-is-from-which-dlc.png)

Example: Deluxe and Wasteland pack are not installed (gray icons). Sparks of the Future, Frostbite, Economy, and Style Pack are installed (white icons).

When you are in [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode") and press [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to [paint](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color") blocks a different color, then you also choose texture skins. Some textures may not be available to you due to DLCs: You can tell by the icon in the bottom-right corner of the texture which skin comes from which DLC.

*   The skins without icon are available to everyone.
*   If the icon is white, you have bought the DLC and can use the skin.
*   If the icon is gray, you have not bought this DLC and cannot paint this texture.
