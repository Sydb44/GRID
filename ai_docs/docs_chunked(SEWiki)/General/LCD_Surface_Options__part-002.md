Sci-Fi Button Panels from the Sparks of the Future DLC

Using default images from the bult-in list ensures that all players can see them without issues even without loading mods. See below for alternatives how to set up custom images.

*   Loaded Textures -- Select from the list of default images, then click **Add to Selection** to display it. You can add more than one image and cycle, but you can only see one at a time.
*   Selected Textures -- Lists the images to be displayed. To stop using an image, select it here and click **Remove Selected**.
*   Image Change Interval -- Enter a delay in seconds. If you have selected several images, they are displayed one after the other with this delay in between. This allows for simple slideshow-like animations. Set it to zero to disable the slideshow.
*   Preserve Aspect Ratio -- Toggle this if an image comes out distorted. When using the built-in posters, also try the "H" and "V" variants to see whether their aspect ratios look better.

## Tips

*   You can configure text settings, or image settings, or both. If you provide both text and image, it will display the text on top of the image, which adds nice flexibility to create your own combinations of icons and custom messages.
*   If you select the image named "Faction" here, you'll get a generic static "Red Fist" logo. To get _your own_ faction logo, you want to choose the "Faction icon" _app_ instead.

### How to Display Custom Images

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/LCD.png/320px-LCD.png?8b7f78)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:LCD.png)

Displaying special images using pixels in Monospace font

First, consider if custom images (mods!) are needed at all or whether they cannot be approximated by using [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) and a monospaced font.

Second, consider creating your custom image out of Monospace text using [Unicode Block Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements) as pixels.

Or download this great community app that converts any pictures into (slightly performance heavy) Block Element text: [Whips-Image-Converter](https://github.com/Whiplash141/Whips-Image-Converter/) To load the image:

1.  Run Whips-Image-Converter and convert an image to (garbled looking) text.
2.  In SE, select **Text and Images** as your LCD Panel content.
3.  Click **Edit Text**, click into the box. Paste the code generated by Whip's Image Converter and click OK.
4.  Important: Select the 'Monospace' font.
5.  If the image is zoomed in too much, ctrl-click the font size slider and enter 0.1. If it's too tiny, try 0.5 or 1.0. Adjust as necessary.

The only disadvantage of this method is that images are blurry (pixelated), lag-inducing, and stamp-sized pictures take up hundreds of kilobytes. The advantage is that this method works even on multiplayer servers and without mods, but it is best used sparingly.

## Power

LCD surfaces need power to function.

*   Without power, LCDs display an 'Offline' text.
*   While powered but unconfigured ('No Content'), they display the text 'Online' or the picture of a keyboard.
*   While powered and configured, they display text/images or apps.

## LCD Scripts

If you are looking for an option to display inventory capacity, radar view, planetary maps, hull integrity, and the like, unfortunately, such apps are not available by default.

To calculate and display this type of information, you need a [Programmable Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block") Script. Advanced players can write [custom scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripting "Scripting"), and everyone can download [community-provided scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripts "Scripts") from the [Workshop](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Workshop "Workshop") that can be configured to output info from the Programmable Block to an LCD of your choice.

Scripts can display "barcharts" for the fill levels of cargo, remaining fuel, ship damage status, etc. dynamically, simply by printing sequences of Block Elements or text characters to the screen once per second, to fake portable "graphics" cheaply.

## LCD Mods

To display custom static images, look for an LCD image mod.

A more advanced alternative is writing your own image mod: [How to make a custom LCD image mod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/How_to_make_a_custom_LCD_image_mod "How to make a custom LCD image mod"). It's important to create the custom image in the described size and format.

[Button Pad - Touch App](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933676834) is a mod that turns LCD surfaces into configurable interactive touch pads! After installing, select this mod as one of the available LCD Apps.
