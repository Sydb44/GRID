The Top Mounted Camera is a functionally equivalent variant of the [Camera](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Camera "Camera"). You can build it only if you have purchased the [Automatons Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automatons_Pack "Automatons Pack") DLC.

## Usage

For usage details such as zoom, see [Camera](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Camera "Camera").

## Construction

You can build this block on large and small grid.

The big difference to the non-DLC camera is the view angle: The standard camera looks forward orthogonally relative to its single mount point, while the top-mounted camera points at a 90 degree angle relative to its single mount point.
