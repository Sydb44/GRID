The Prometheus is a derelict ship which can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is enabled in your world. It can be found by following the "[SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") for 1s every minute, from a distance of 7-25 km.

## Description

THis is a large wreck. It is possible to restore the ship, however it is a real challenge in survival mode. The ship contains multiple decorative DLC blocks, which will be visible, but will not provide components if grinded down, if the player does not have the DLC installed.

## Spoilers

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

Engineers should aproach with great caution, as there are a few still active interior turrets mounted on the ships hull, and two warheads (in one of the two variants) that are armed when sensors in their vicinity are triggered. Ocasionally, multiple salvage drones and turret mines will also spawn next to the wreck.

The ship does not contain any notable cargo, only components from salvaging the wreck, as the most damage to the ship occurred at the large cargo container section. 

## The original ship

[The original build](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=698387294) is by Chabin on Steam, and the build was adopted into the world by Keen as a random encounter. There are two versions of the Encounter in the game: "Prometheus A" and "Prometheus B" with one difference: the presence of warheads.
