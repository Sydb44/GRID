# Control Panel Screen - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The control panel gives access to the settings of all connected functional blocks of a grid.

Press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") while in a cockpit or while targeting a grid terminal port to open the terminal on the **Control Panel** tab.

The main purpose of the control panel is to give you direct access to all functionalities, status indicators, and properties of functional blocks that you own. You can group blocks here to change their settings in bulk, or toggle functional blocks on or off. Find the functional block in the list on the left and use the drop-down menus, buttons, and sliders to configure block settings.

## Naming Functional Blocks

On this screen, you can also change the names of blocks. You can filter the list of functional blocks and containers easily by typing (part of) a block name into the top-left searchbar.

Tip: In general, add the (shortened) shipname as a prefix to give blocks unique names. This is important when you dock (using [Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") or [Merge Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block")) to another [ship/station](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid"), because all blocks will be listed together in the Control Panel Screen.

Other reasons to a rename blocks:

*   To make blocks that you often need better findable in the list, rename them so that they are listed at the top.
*   To filter down to a set of ungrouped blocks that you often use together, add a unique search keyword to the blocks' names.
*   To disguise blocks minimally, rename traps to something harmless.
*   To distinguish similar blocks in different locations, clearly name directional thrusters, front and back wheel suspensions, positional/exterior/interior lights, special cargo containers, directional connectors, etc.

Some [scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripts "Scripts") also require named blocks.

## How to Control Blocks

Each type of functional block has settings that can be controlled from this screen. These settings, such as area of effect, properties, or automatic behaviours, are discussed on each specific block's page.

You can control a block "live" (from a control seat or through a [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control")/[Remote Access Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Access_Screen "Remote Access Screen")), and see the effects of the changed setting right away, for example gyrosope overrides, wheel settings, or light colour changes.

When you close the control panel, the game saves your current control settings and applies them from now on. For example, if you have set a turret to target neutrals, the effect only becomes noticeable later when a neutral player approaches.

## How to Create Control Groups

You group blocks in the control panel by selecting them and assigning the new group a name.

1.  Hold [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and click every block to include.  
    Or click the first consecutive block, hold [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and click the last consecutive block.
2.  Then type a unique group name in the text box on the right. It's highly recommended to prefix the name with the name of the ship!
3.  Click **Save**.

Groups are listed first in the control panel and are marked with asterisks.

Interacting with the group lets you switch all group members on and off. It also lets you access fine controls of the same block type, as long as all blocks are of the same kind and have the same settings when being grouped. For instance, if you create a group containing only doors, then the "open" and "close" actions will become available for this group, because doors are of the same kind.

You can assign and trigger group actions in the Control Panel, [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar"), [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block"), [Sensors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor"), and so on.

## How to Declutter the Control Panel Screen

If your [Terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal") is getting too long and cluttered, it’s time to hide blocks that you never directly use from being listed there. This is helpful for grids with long lists of functional blocks, large inventories, many docked ships, or too many entries in the toolbar configuration menu.

You can toggle the following settings:

*   **Show block in [terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal")** - default: on.  
    This controls visibility in the list of functional blocks. Typically you hide blocks for which you have created a control group.
*   **Show block in [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") system** — default: on
*   **Show block in [toolbar config](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar")** — default: on.
*   **Show block on HUD** -- default: off.  
    Used to declutter the [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"). Typically, blocks are not shown as [signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal") on the HUD, but you can choose to show them temporarily to be able to find specific blocks on a large ship.

Not seeing the blocks you expected in the Control Panel? Click the **Eye** button next to the searchbar to show all hidden blocks!

## How to change Block ownership

The Control Panel screen is also where you legally change or transfer the [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") of functional blocks that you own (in contrast to [hacking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking") blocks that you don't own). You do that for example, because you want to share grids with your faction, or to prevent enemy factions from using grids owned by nobody.

Select a functional block on the left side and use the ownership menu on the right side to assign ownership to another online player, or to share usage with your faction members.
