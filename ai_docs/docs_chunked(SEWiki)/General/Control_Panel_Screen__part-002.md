    This controls visibility in the list of functional blocks. Typically you hide blocks for which you have created a control group.
*   **Show block in [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") system** — default: on
*   **Show block in [toolbar config](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar")** — default: on.
*   **Show block on HUD** -- default: off.  
    Used to declutter the [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"). Typically, blocks are not shown as [signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal") on the HUD, but you can choose to show them temporarily to be able to find specific blocks on a large ship.

## How to change Block ownership

The Control Panel screen is also where you legally change or transfer the [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") of functional blocks that you own (in contrast to [hacking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking") blocks that you don't own). You do that for example, because you want to share grids with your faction, or to prevent enemy factions from using grids owned by nobody.

Select a functional block on the left side and use the ownership menu on the right side to assign ownership to another online player, or to share usage with your faction members.

## Quality of Life Shortcuts

Sliding a control slider with [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-drag is fast but imprecise.

*   To quickly reset a slider to its default, [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click it.  
    This shortcut is valuable to quickly reset overrides or velocities to zero, e.g. to stop moving [Mechanical Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") or overriden [Gyroscopes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope").

*   To quickly set a slider to a specific value, [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click it, enter the number into the dialog, and click **OK**.

## How to view block power use and modifiers

In the bottom right panel of the Control Panel, you see additional status information about the selected block:

*   block type
*   required power input — or for [power producing blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power"), power output
*   installed [modules](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Upgrade_Modules "Upgrade Modules") (if applicable)

And so on.

## How to view subgrid info

The Control Panel also gives you implicit information about multigrids:

*   Blocks in white text are directly part of the main grid from which you have opened the panel.
*   Blocks in orange-yellow-green coloured text are [subgrids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid"), seen relative to the main grid.
