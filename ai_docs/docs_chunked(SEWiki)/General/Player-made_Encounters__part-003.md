1.  Create a new world in creative mode.
2.  Edit the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"):
    1.  Enable 1 or more encounters in the advanced settings.
    2.  Click **Mods** to install your new mod.
3.  To speed up the testing process, paste in a fast jump ship or use [Admin tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") to teleport yourself to encounters to check out whether they are yours.
4.  Then switch to Survival mode and test whether it acts as expected.

While testing, set e.g. <Frequency>10</Frequency> to make the modded encounter that your are testing appear more often.

While testing, open the SE log in a text editor and search for the name of your mod to find error messages quick. (See [Where are my log files?](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Support#Where_are_My_Log_Files? "Support").) Wrong ID names and unbalanced XML tags are the most common errors. While the game is running, NotePad++ will sometimes ask whether you want to reload the log file in the editor, that's normal, reload it.

If a planetary encounter spawns the wrong way round, change the [Grid Pivot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid_Pivot "Grid Pivot").
