### Static grid? Mobile grid?

A grid is either static or mobile.

Examples of static grids are:

*   bases on planets
*   bases on asteroids
*   stationary cranes
*   airfields and landing pads
*   space stations (geostationary)

Examples of mobile grids are:

*   spaceships (any grids with [thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster "Thruster"))
*   race cars, trucks, and rovers (any grids with [wheels and suspensions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension "Wheel Suspension"))
*   [Mechas](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker") (any grids using [mechanical legs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") to walk)
*   mobile utility machines, miners, fork lifts, constructors, salvagers, mobile cranes (with any combination of mobility blocks)

... and what ever creative thing you can think of!

Under specific conditions, it is possible to convert grids between static and mobile. For details, see [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen").

## What does welding mean?

When you place blocks in [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"), they will appear fully built ("welded") in the world.

In contrast, in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"), placed blocks appear as _unwelded_ frames.

*   Unwelded frames already have the mass and solidity of the finished blocks, and they already carry electricity.
*   Unwelded [landing gears](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") are already magnetic.
*   Unwelded frames have almost no hitpoints, which makes them quick and cheap to build, but very fragile when hit by one stray bullet or collisions.
*   Unwelded functional blocks will not have any functionality, and they use no power.
*   Unwelded conveyors and ports do not extend the [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system").

Unwelded blocks have several build states.

Therefore, in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"), to benefit from the full functionality and hitpoints of a placed block, you must weld up the block. You have two options:

While you weld up blocks, they visibly progress through several build states.

Which components are still missing? Point the hand-held welder at a block to get a [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") tooltip in the top right, listing required and missing components. Use the [Build Planner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Build_Planner "Build Planner") to keep track of needed components for manual welding.

  
The block is functional once the required materials are welded up and the progressbar meets the Functional Line (red indicator bar in the tooltip).

## What does grinding mean?

The constructor ship with grinder and welder was one of the first included ships (2014).

Grinding a block removes it from the grid and returns the components into your inventory. If your inventory is full, components drop to the ground or float away in space, so beware.

Before grinding a block, verify that the block is not the only thing holding two halves of the grid together, so the grid does not break in two. (If that happens, fix it with [Merge blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block").)

Players use [handheld grinders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_\(Tool\) "Grinder (Tool)") and ships can use [Grinder Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_Block "Grinder Block").
