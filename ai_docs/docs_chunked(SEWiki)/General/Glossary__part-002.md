_**g**_ or [**g-force:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force) - Acceleration unit where 1 _g_ is 9.81 m/s2 in this game, which is the real Earth's gravity acceleration (9.80665 m/s2) rounded up.

**[GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS"):** n. Galactic or Global Positioning System. Three numbers that tell you where a static point is in 3D space. In game, locations on planets and space stations are static.

**Gravity Drive:** n. A gravity drive uses [Artificial Mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Mass "Artificial Mass") blocks and [Gravity Generators](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator") on the same ship to move the ship without any thrusters.

**Greeble:** v. To decorate a featureless surface by adding detail and depth. n. The non-functional blocks repurposed as sci-fi decorations. Originally used in film studios by Star Wars ship modellers. Examples: "Stop greebling!", "Many greebles where lost in the collision, but the ship remained functional."

**Grid:** n. [Building blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") in the game are arranged on a grid. In extension, any block structure you build, such as spaceships, rovers, [stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Station "Station"), [Mechas](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker"), etc. is referred to as a [grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid"). We distinguish mobile grids and [stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Station "Station"), and [small](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid") and [large](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") grids.

**Grinder Pit:** n. An array of conveyored [grinders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_Block "Grinder Block") built so that wrecks exposed to the combined area of effect are salvaged quickly. See also welder wall or collector pit.

**Gyro:** n. A  [![Icon Block Gyroscope.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Gyroscope.png/21px-Icon_Block_Gyroscope.png?c8eb45)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") [Gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") is a device used for stabilisation and control of attitude rotation (pitch, yaw, and roll) of a ship, vehicle, or walker etc.

## H

**Hacking:** n. To take [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") of a neutral or enemy block and use its control panel, you use the [Hacking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking") game mechanic.

**The Hack Line:** n. When you face a block with a grinder in hand and look at the construction tooltip in the top right, you see a blue horizontal marker below the  [![Icon Item Computer.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Computer.png/21px-Icon_Item_Computer.png?65c1a4)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Computer "Computer") [Computer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Computer "Computer") components. This is the hack line. Example: "To gain [Ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership"), grind the Cockpit _below the hack line_ and reweld it."

**Hangar:** n. An enclosed space inside a station or mothership to [dock](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Docking "Docking") smaller vessels safely. In the hangar, spacecraft are built, repaired, and stored.

**Hitbox:** n. An invisible simplified representation of the shape of a block used by the game's physics simulation. Oversized hitboxes were fixed in [Version 1.196](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Version/1.196 "Version/1.196"), greatly reducing destructive friction (_clang_) and allowing for more dynamic mechanical builds. Also known as collision shape or boundary volume in game development.

**Hydroman:** n, v. A portmanteau of [hydrogen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") and man, that refers to the act of abusing the high speed of the hydrogen-fuelled [Jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") to catch up with ships instead of using an engineering solution, often in the context of piracy or boarding.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

## I

**Inertia:** n. The natural resistance of physical objects to changes in speed and direction. In space, inertia causes spaceships and jetpacks to continue drifting after only a single burst of the thrusters. Since we are used to the slowing effects of friction, dealing with frictionless inertia poses a challenge for human pilots’ intuition.

**[Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers"):** n. A fictional device that negates the unintuitive effects of frictionless inertia in zero gravity to facilitate manual manoeuvring.

## K

**Keel:** n. The bottom, ventral side of the ship. Opposite of topside.

**[Keen Software House](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Keen_Software_House "Keen Software House"):** n. The indie game dev studio lead by Marek Rosa in Prague that has (among other things) created Space Engineers.

**Klang:** n. Alternate spelling of [Clang](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Clang "Clang").

## L

**Lag:** n. High network latency in an online game means that after a player’s input, the game server’s reaction lags behind, which poses an obstacle in real-time (not turn-based) games.

## M

**Mecha:** n. See [Walker](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker").

**Mechanics:** n. The area of engineering and physics concerned with the behaviour of objects when subjected to forces or displacements. Examples of [mechanical blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") in game are  [![Icon Block Piston.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Piston.png/21px-Icon_Block_Piston.png?8b1fda)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Piston "Piston") [Piston](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Piston "Piston")s,  [![Icon Block Rotor.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Rotor.png/21px-Icon_Block_Rotor.png?127e75)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") [Rotor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rotor "Rotor")s,  [![Icon Block Hinge.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Hinge.png/21px-Icon_Block_Hinge.png?672bc9)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hinge "Hinge") [Hinge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hinge "Hinge")s, and [Wheel Suspensions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension "Wheel Suspension").

**Mod:** n. A mod is a community created game modification, ranging from decorative and functional blocks or skins, to new gameplay, quality of life additions, and whole custom planets. See also [Mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods") and [Modding](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding "Modding").

**Moon:** n. A celestial body of any shape that orbits a larger [planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") (or rarely, an asteroid) as a natural satellite.
