The voxel hands tool placing voxels in mid-air

The Voxel Hands terraforming tool can be used to shape [voxels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Voxels "Voxels"), that is, asteroids and planets, and change their materials. For example, you can replace ores and stone, paint roads or grass on the ground, create cliff walls or flat plains, fill in meteorite craters, shape valleys, dig caves, and much more.

Voxel Hands have been added in update 01.067.

## What painted voxels look like

[Smokki's Carcosa Valley Colony](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1640522219) scenario, a landscape also known from the [Lost Colony Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lost_Colony_Scenario "Lost Colony Scenario"), shows exemplary use of how to "paint" with voxel hands to create roads.

## Performance considerations

Important: Making too many voxel changes worsens performance. On multiplayer servers, an admin can reset voxel changes (that is, fill in underground bases and mines) if they cause lag.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that Voxel Hands are enabled in the Advanced category of the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") of the game save.

The Voxel Hands tool is available in [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"). In [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") singleplayer, enable Creative Tools in the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen"), and in Survival Mode multiplayer, you may need permission to install mods such as Digi's Concrete Tool if you are not the admin.

## How to Use Voxel Hands

1.  Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") configuration menu.
2.  Select the **Voxel Hands** category on the left-hand side and then drag brush shapes to assign them to numbered slots in your toolbar:
    *   Box - rectangular
    *   Capsule - a cylinder with rounded ends
    *   Ramp - triangular
    *   Sphere - round
    *   Terrain Auto Level - gravity aligned and flat
3.  Press a number key to select one of these shapes now.
4.  Press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the voxel hand settings. Here you choose the shape size and the tool's behaviour:
    *   **Shape width**  
        Select a size from 1 to 100.
    *   **Shape height**  
        Select a size from 1 to 100.
    *   **Shape length**  
        Select a size from 1 to 100.
    *   **Snap to Voxelgrid** (Default: on)  
        Aligns changes to a regular grid; disable this if the alignment limits you too much.
    *   **Project to Voxel** (Default: off)  
        The tool only works when directly pointing at existing voxels.
    *   **Freeze physics** (Default: off)  
        Don't let the voxel changes push mobile grids (?)
    *   **Show bounding box** (Default: on)  
        Shows a visual hint of the area in which the tool can be activated.
5.  Press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the settings window.
6.  Lastly, select a [voxel material](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Voxels "Voxels"):
    *   Press [\[ key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to select next voxel material
    *   Press [\] key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to select previous voxel material

Preview of all included voxel materials

You'll see a preview of the material and its name in the bottom right of your HUD, under the gravity reading.

Voxel Hand shapes in the toolbar, with Box shape selected, and gold material selected.

When you now click in mid air, you can place voxels in their pure shape ("box" shaped for example). Or if you click existing voxels, their shape will merge organically and adjust to the existing voxel.

## Remove Voxels

To delete voxels, select a Voxel Hand shape and hold [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right"). It works more reliably when you don't stand too close. Or use a [drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drill "Drill"), as you do in Survival Mode.

## Replace Voxels (Paint)

Instead of adding or removing Voxels, you can also replace their material without changing the shape. Similar to painting blocks, select a material and shape first, and then [![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-click to change voxel materials.

For example, after you have shaped a wilderness trail, you paint its surface a more worn out colour, or you paint a road gray. A scenario designer or server admin could paint a boulder "gold" to add ores to locations for gameplay or story reasons.
