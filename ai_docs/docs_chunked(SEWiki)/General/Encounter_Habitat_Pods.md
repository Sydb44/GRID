[![The Wreckage of the Habitat pods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Habitat_Pods_1.png/446px-Habitat_Pods_1.png?87f8d8)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Habitat_Pods_1.png "The Wreckage of the Habitat pods")

The Habitat Pods encounter consists of 7 pods, 6 of which are wrecked and in various states of damage. It can be found by following the "[SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") for 1s every minute, from a distance of 7-25 km.

The MAYDAY signal is broadcast from the one functional, and pressurized pod among the others, with a few modifications to it, most notably the [Solar Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel") attached to a structure of [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") and a [Beacon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Beacon "Beacon").

## Threats

There are two main threats present in this encounter, one is an [Interior Turret](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Interior_Turret "Interior Turret") mounted on top of the functional pod, and another is a [Warhead](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warhead "Warhead") trap inside of one of the ransacked pods, which is instantly triggered when an engineer gets too close to it.

## Contents

There are a good amount of above-average tools inside of the lockers of some of the pods, as well as some ingots and components. Most pods have an [O2/H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") that contains some [Ice](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice"). Inside of the functional pod there are some rarer components and elite tools. There is also a rifle with a few [5.56x45mm NATO magazines](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/5.56x45mm_NATO_magazine "5.56x45mm NATO magazine") with it. Overall this encounter is a relatively safe one for an acquainted engineer that has a very good amount of starting loot, but other than that, there is not much for a well equipped engineer.

## Notes

*   Inside of the functional pod there is a [LCD Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Panels "LCD Panels") depicting a log of the previous inhabitant of the vessel that reads:
