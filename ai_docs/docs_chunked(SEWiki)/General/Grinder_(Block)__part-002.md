A Grinder Pit is a room full of Grinder Blocks whose areas of effect overlap, typically with a large opening on top. You throw wrecks and [cargo drops](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unknown_Signals "Unknown Signals") in the pit to have them dismantled automatically.

Instead of dropping the wrecks, you can also hold them in place using landing gear on pistons, and push the wreck into the Grinder Pit in a more controlled fashion, similar in structure to a [3D Printer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer"), but opposite in function.

When dismantling mobile grids, be prepared for loose blocks being ejected from the grinder pit, or parts drifting off in low gravity and crashing into your ship. Wrecks of mobile grids no longer stabilise themselves and are affected by physical forces that can damage other grids.

Wreck pieces ejecting and damaging your salvage ship are no issue when grinding down static (!) stations using a grinder ship. One of the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") determines whether unsupported parts of stations will drift away or remain static.

## Damage

When active, the area of effect of the grinder blades is lethal to players in Survival Mode.

Similar to  [![Icon Block Landing Gear.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/2/2d/Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png/21px-Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png?d381be)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") and [Wheels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel "Wheel"), the Grinder itself is resistant to damage from collisions. Assuming one approaches the wreck at reasonable speeds, there should be little danger of harming the Grinder during normal use.

## Range

The Grinder Block's range is 3 small blocks (1.5m) on small ships, and 4 small blocks (2.0m) on a large ship. Range is spherical and centered roughly at the center of the grinder blades.

## Power

The Grinder uses 2 kW of power, regardless of whether it's mounted on a small or large ship. Its power usage doesn't change when it has something to grind away versus when it's just idly spinning.

## Inventory

With "Realistic" settings, the Grinder Block has an inventory with a capacity of 13,500L on large ships and stations and 2,500L for small ships. The inventory holds typically [component](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component") type items, which is the type of salvage collected while it operates. But it accepts ores and other items as well — in case you grind a cargo container, the Grinder Block can hold the contents.

If attached to a [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"), Grinder Block will automatically push its contents to other valid inventories. The inventory is flagged to send items to blocks that pull them, for example, an [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") in Disassembler mode.[\[1\]](http://forums.keenswh.com/post/show_single_post?pid=1282594029&postcount=1)

## Construction

The Grinder Block exists for large and small grid. The block is quite unwieldy as it takes up 2x1x1 blocks space on large ships and 6x3x3 blocks space on small ships. It has mount points on the five sides of its cubic back half.

It has a large conveyor port on the backside and it has a small inventory. Always connect Welders to a conveyor system or cargo containers to store the salvage. On small grids, to be able to transfer all salvaged components, use 3x3 Hinges and Advanced Rotors, do not use small-grid pistons nor Small Conveyors.

Leave space in front and next to the Grinder Block for the area of effect.

Engineers typically engage multiple grinders to dismantle large wrecks quickly -- but on multiplayer servers, be aware of PCU limits prohibiting that.
