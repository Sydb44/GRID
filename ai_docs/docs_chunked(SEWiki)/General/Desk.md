The Desk is a large-grid decorative block. It can only be welded and placed by people who have purchased the [Decorative Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack "Decorative Pack") DLC, but it can be used by all players.

## Usage

The block is made up of a plain, narrow desktop along one edge, plus one seat. To enter the seat, press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Sitting at the desk charges the seated engineer's suit as long as the grid is powered. You can sit in this seat safely during a [jump](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive"). You can combine the Desk and [Desk Corner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Desk_Corner "Desk Corner") blocks so that another player can sit at the front end of the desk.

## Construction

It takes up 1x1x1 large-grid blocks but leaves most of the space free to walk past.
