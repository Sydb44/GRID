The Inset Bookshelf is a decorative block. You can only build it if you have purchased the [Decorative Pack 3](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack_3 "Decorative Pack 3") DLC.

## Usage

Decorative blocks make living quarters look more inhabited. The front face of the Inset Bookshelf block shows a bookshelf filled with books and toys. The right face is a coffee kitchen with three cups, microwave, and drawers. The decorations do not take up the full block faces, so you can combine this block with [desks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Desk "Desk"), [couches](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Couch "Couch"), or other blocks. The other four sides are practically undecorated.

## Inventory

The Inset Bookshelf has an inventory of 400 L and no conveyor access ports. The inventory is only accessible directly, by pressing [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and only from the front face and the right face.

## Trivia

The bookshelf contains an [Engineer Plushie](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Engineer_Plushie "Engineer Plushie"), [Saberoid Plushie](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Saberoid_Plushie "Saberoid Plushie"), cups, and books with the following titles/symbols:

*   Oxygen
*   Space Jokes
*   High Voltage
*   Saberoid Biology
*   Moving Parts
*   History of Miner Wars 2081
*   Rocket Science
*   How to Spell [Klang](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Klang "Klang")
*   Light Reading Vol 6
*   Engineering for Dummies
*   Good AI[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)
*   Type (with Barcode) (?)
*   (Ammo icon)
*   (Antenna icon)
*   (life support/heart symbol)

The cups on the shelf say "I love [R.O.S.](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)")".

## Construction

If [Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is on, you need to build an Interior Wall first to unlock it. The Inset Bookshelf block is artight and can be built on large grid only.
