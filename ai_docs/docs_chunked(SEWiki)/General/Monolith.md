There's a [Steam achievement](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Steam_Achievements "Steam Achievements") called "Monolith". The relevant monolith can only be found in the following [Original Content](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content") games: Earth Planet, Mars Planet, Alien Planet, Moon Base. There is no monolith in the [Star System game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game").

The introduction of this mysterious artefact is probably alluding to the movie [Space Odyssey 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith_\(Space_Odyssey\)). [The First Jump Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_First_Jump_Scenario "The First Jump Scenario") tells the artefactâ€™s background story as part of the Space Engineers lore.

## Trivia

The second monolith is jokingly called stereolith, alluding to the fact that mono audio has one channel and stereo has two (or more) channels. While mono- indeed means one, stereo- does not mean two, but it means spatial (3D audio).

## Spoilers

Unveiling these will _spoil_ the experience of finding them yourself.

Description of the location(s)

There is a monolith on the surface of Mars and another one on the surface of the Moon. They are small and not easy to spot.
