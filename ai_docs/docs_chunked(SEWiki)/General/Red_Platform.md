# Red Platform - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Red Platform is the asteroid station in the [Quick Start](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Quick_Start "Quick Start")/[Red Ship v2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Ship_v2 "Red Ship v2") [Sandbox Game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game").

## Red Platform - Topside

The topside is the work area.

*   Refinery, Assembler, Upgrade Modules, Connector[\[1\]](#cite_note-1). Below this factory is an entrance.
*   Antenna dish on a hinge on the bottom of platform
*   Gatling turret against meteors
*   A small reactor
*   Two large cargo containers
*   Gravity Generator set to 0.61g
*   Connector next to a collector
*   Grinder pit with safety sensor
*   Corner Medical Room
*   A foldable walkway on hinges

## Red Platform - Building 49

The building is labeled "49" contains the flight control tower and the living quarters of the asteroid base inhabitant.

Push the outside button to open the airlock and enter the airlock chamber. Note the main entrance into the base and the back exit. Push the interior button to close the outside airlock doors. Note that the airlock mechanism switches off the doors and buttons to protect the user from accidental venting. You can study this mechanism and learn from it!

*   Ground floor: Pressurised living quarters. Come in here to recharge your suit's life support. There are stairs leading up.
*   Upper floor: Upstairs, you find the flight control tower with consoles and many buttons. Two of the buttons, for example, send coordinates and status to the chat. "[Broadcast Controller](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Broadcast_Controller "Broadcast Controller") 2" sends a random warning messages when the [Console Module](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Console_Module "Console Module") gets target locked (?), and it sends its own GPS coordinates after the target lock has been released.  
    Tip: Find the hidden "big red button" to play an alarm...

Outside on top of the tower you see a [Truss Light](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Truss_Light "Truss Light") on a [Truss Decoy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Truss_Decoy "Truss Decoy") next to a [Compact Antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Compact_Antenna "Compact Antenna").

## Red Platform - Backside

On the backside of building 49, you follow a trail out onto the asteroid. The trail leads to the mine and the solar array.

*   Mining tunnel: The tunnel contains a scientific room with an ore detector (push the button) and explosives (don't push the button). Next to it, you find a small iron and ice mine. After switching on the ore detector, notice another drillable ore vein below the others.
*   Solar Array: The solar array is build out of individual panels. Note that the array automatically rotates towards the sun: Look at the setup of the [Custom Turret Controller](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Custom_Turret_Controller "Custom Turret Controller"), [Hinge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hinge "Hinge"), [Rotor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rotor "Rotor"), and [Camera](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Camera "Camera").

## Red Platform - Bottom Floor

The rooms below the platform are not pressurised (no oxygen). It contains various storage, one Cryo Chamber, Consoles, and buttons. There are several entrances:

*   One ladder comes out below the grinder pit on the platform
*   One ladder comes out in front of the refinery on the topside of the platform.
*   One backdoor comes out under the oxygen tank under the refinery.

One conveyor is broken that needs repair.

## Red Platform - Access Bridge

On the side of the platform where the large Red Ship is parked, you find an access bridge. The bridge is on hinges and can fold away to clear the flight path. Under the bridge is a sensor that detects large ships and sends a goodbye message to the chat when the ship leaves.

To study this mechanism, open the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") of the Action Relay block: It activates the walkway hinges, plays a sound, transmits a chat message through the "[Broadcast Controller](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Broadcast_Controller "Broadcast Controller")" block ("Stand by, preparing for departure."). Then it starts the Timer named "[Timer Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block")" that waits 3 sec and toggles off the [Action Relay](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Action_Relay "Action Relay") and broadcasts the chat message "Flight path clear. Ready for launch."
