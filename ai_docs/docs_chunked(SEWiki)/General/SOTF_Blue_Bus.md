This small-grid bus is parked in the "backstage" area of the Central Asteroid of the [Sparks of the Future](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sparks_of_the_Future_Scenario "Sparks of the Future Scenario") [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario"). The bus has two doors, a control seat, and a passenger seat; both seats have wide panoramic windows.

For passenger comfort, it has an o2/h2 generator and two air vents. It doesn't have an airlock, but it is parked at a bus-sized airlock, outside the central main hall of SOTF. From this airlock, the bus can take passengers to two landing pads.

It has one gyroscope, a connector, and a small reactor. Now, you may ask, how do we drive a bus _on an asteroid_? To stick to the ground inside the field of the stationâ€™s gravity generators, it uses three [artifical mass blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Mass "Artificial Mass").
