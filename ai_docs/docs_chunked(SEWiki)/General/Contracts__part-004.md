### Search

Have you lost track of a drone that is still powered and listed on your [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen")? Or do you simply want to show off your creative building skills and provide exploration content on a multiplayer server?

Leave a powered Grid anywhere and pay other players to “find” it. You gain nothing but a nice roleplay/PvP opportunity.

1.  Select one **Target grid** of yours.
2.  Provide a **search radius** between 0 and 99999 metres. The optimal distance depends on the size of the target. For example, for small-grid targets like cargo drops, choose less than 1000m.
3.  Leave the Collateral at zero.
4.  Enter a **payment** in [space credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits").

Consider whether you need a Safe Zone around the target grid, otherwise players may grind it down.

### Hauling

A Hauling Contracts' only purpose is to let players find one of your grids, typically your Trade Outposts. You cannot choose what the Package item will be. You gain nothing but coordinates and a nice roleplay/PvP opportunity.

1.  You must build and own two trade outposts with separate Contracts blocks, because Hauling needs a start and delivery location. Outposts built and shared by faction members are not an option.
2.  Requirements: The start and delivery locations...
    *   must be _owned and built by you_,
    *   must be powered, and
    *   must be able to reach each other by ([laser](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Laser_Antenna "Laser Antenna")) [antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna"). (TODO: re-check whether that's required?)
3.  At the Contracts block in the start location:
    *   Select the Contracts block at your delivery location as **Target Block** from the list. If it's not listed, check the requirements!
    *   Enter how much **Payment** you offer as an incentive (in Space Credits).
    *   Request a **Collateral** (in Space Credits).

## Multiplayer Ideas

In general, consider whether you will need to prevent visitors from disassembling your Search contract targets and player-owned Trade Outposts. A Safe Zone is less necessary if you play PvE with friends, and quite necessary on public PvP servers. Your factions can build [Safe Zones](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone"), and admins can also set up Admin Safe Zones for free.

### Player Faction-Owned Trading Outposts

A player faction-owned Trading Outpost is often one monolithic building, but it doesn’t have to be. [Contracts Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts_Block "Contracts Block") have strict ownership requirements and they don’t work on faction-shared grids. To fulfil the ownership requirement, a faction can build a large-grid “shopping street” inside one Safe Zone that contains several separate "shops" that are built, owned, and powered by individual faction members and contain separate Contracts blocks. The shop segments can be connected with landing gears or connectors to appear as a whole to other players.

### Role-Playing Opportunities

Contracts can be used as a way to provide other players with the coordinates of exploration locations and community events.

*   On vanilla servers, offering Repair and Acquisition contracts is just another means (as part of roleplaying) to pay others to deliver items instead of acquiring them yourself. On modded servers with restricted resources, however, Acquisition contracts can be major gameplay elements.
*   Offering Search and Hauling contracts never gains _you_ any items or money. You basically pay other players an incentive to visit and explore your faction's trading outposts. Set up your turrets so that neutral and friendly players can reach your target location safely to hand in the Contract.
*   Search contracts are a great way to provide exploration content for each other on multiplayer servers. Build a maze with a “lost” grid inside, hide a wrecked rover at the bottom of a crevice, leave a ship wreck in an asteroid field, build a Clang temple ruin in a pretty place in space or on a planet, and so on -- and then use a Search contract to invite other players to explore your build.

Consider that accepting contracts on public PvP (player versus player) servers always brings the risk (and extra excitement) that the target location may be trapped or armed. Or it might shower you with free loot, you won’t know until you go there... ;-)

### Tracking and Surveillance

Your Contracts block can only track grids that you own, but that still opens up many creative secondary usages:

*   If you want to track the location of one of your own ships, build a Contracts block on it. Create a **Hauling** contract in your base with all fields empty, make the delivery location the ship’s Contract block, and immediately accept the contract yourself. It will provide you with a tracking GPS (and a Package item that you can store anywhere in the meantime). When you want to stop tracking, visit the ship and deliver the Package.
*   If you have lost one of your owned grids, create a **Search** contract for it and immediately accept it yourself. Leave all fields empty and only select the target grid name. The contract will give you a private GPS of the location.
*   If you have the opportunity to stick a hidden powered block owned by yourself to an enemy ship, this block can become a tracking device. Simply a Small Battery with a [Magnetic Plate](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Plate "Magnetic Plate") or Landing Gear is enough, it needs no permissions to magnetise and doesn’t show up in the enemy’s control panel. Then create a Search contract for your block and accept it (or have a faction member accept it) to start tracking the enemy’s coordinates. You only run the risk that the enemy finds it by chance and re-uses it as a lure/trap against you. :-)
