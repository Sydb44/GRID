# Radiation - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Radiation hazards present a survival challenge from version 1.207 on.

This feature adds a radiation **Exposure Level** metre to your [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") that goes from 0 (good) to 100 (deadly).

## Requirements

You enable or disable radiation hazards in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") under **Advanced > Environment > Enable Radiation**. It's enabled by default in new games created after update 1.207, and you can retroactively enable it in existing games. You need to enable [airtightness](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") together with radiation in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

To enable the additional solar radiation challenge, go to the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") under **Advanced > Environment > Solar Radiation Intensity**. It's disabled by default. You can choose from Disabled, Light, Medium, or Heavy intensity. Solar Radiation requires Airtightness and Radiation to be enabled.

## Mechanics

Near a source of radiation, your exposure levels increase slowly. In safe areas, your radiation levels decrease slowly.

High radiation levels are bad for the engineer's health. From 75% radiation on, you start taking more and more health damage until you [die](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death").

## Radiation sources

The radiation sources are:

*   Planetary radiation:
    *   The [Moon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Moon "Moon") and [Europa](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Europa "Europa") are very irradiated.
    *   [Mars](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mars "Mars"), [Pertam](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pertam "Pertam"), and [Titan](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Titan "Titan") are a bit irradiated.
    *   The atmospheres of the [EarthLike Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EarthLike_Planet "EarthLike Planet"), the [Alien planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Alien_planet "Alien planet"), and [Triton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Triton "Triton") provide full protection against radiation.
*   Weather radiation
    *   Electric Storm on Pertam and toxic haze on Alien irradiate you.
*   Block radiation:
    *   Damaged reactors will leak strong radiation, whether they contain uranium or not. This radiation leaks through blocks, into cockpits, or into airtight rooms.
    *   The [Prototech Fusion Reactor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech_Fusion_Reactor "Prototech Fusion Reactor") does _not_ produce radiation when damaged.
*   Solar radiation:
    *   (if enabled in the World Settings)
    *   Being exposed to sunlight irradiates you: Space, the Moon, and Europa, have full solar radiation intensity.
    *   You counter solar radiation by being in the shade, under a roof, or behind glass, underground, in an asteroid, or in the planetary atmospheres of the planets Earthlike, Alien, Titan, or Triton.
    *   Small grid cockpits and the thin atmospheres of Mars and Pertam provide only limited protection.

## Protection from Radiation

To decrease exposure to natural radiation, spend time in safe areas:

*   on atmospheric planets in good (non extreme) weather
*   moderate weather with clean rain
*   airtight pressurized spaces, such as bases, rovers, space stations, or spaceships
*   in a cockpit with oxygen

To decrease exposure to block radiation, all you can do is stay away from broken reactors. Either only spend short time there to weld it up, or send a welder drone.

## Is there a cure against radiation sickness?

Well, there's an  [![Icon Item Anti-Radiation MedKit.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Anti-Radiation_MedKit.png/21px-Icon_Item_Anti-Radiation_MedKit.png?6ab95e)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Anti-Radiation_MedKit "Anti-Radiation MedKit") [Anti-Radiation MedKit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Anti-Radiation_MedKit "Anti-Radiation MedKit") that prevents radiation from getting worse for 10 minutes per dose, and it decreases existing radiation levels back to zero. However, this MedKit cannot be crafted, only found as loot or traded.
