The Encounter Corvette consists of a powered derelict and abandoned large grid exploration ship that can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is [enabled in your world](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"). It can be found by following the "SPRT.MAYDAY" signal that broadcasts every second on the players HUD. The Corvette is spawned with severe damage near the front and, most prevalent, the right booster being completely severed from the main ship.

## Original

The original blueprint was made by K\_Medlock. It can be found in the Steam workshop under [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=853462583](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=853462583) as the "(AOE) Virtue Exploration Corvette"

## Contents

The ship has no substantial cargo, the only items it contains is one [Hydrogen Bottle](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Bottle "Hydrogen Bottle"), one [Oxygen Bottle](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Bottle "Oxygen Bottle"), 10 [Gatling Ammo Box](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gatling_Ammo_Box "Gatling Ammo Box") in each of the 2 [Gatling Turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gatling_Turret "Gatling Turret") and 20 [5.56x45mm NATO magazines](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/5.56x45mm_NATO_magazine "5.56x45mm NATO magazine") in 4 of the 5 [Interior Turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Interior_Turret "Interior Turret").

The Ship contains:

*   2 [Gatling Turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gatling_Turret "Gatling Turret")
*   5 [Interior Turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Interior_Turret "Interior Turret")
*   1 [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") (Incomplete)
*   6 [O2 H2 Generators](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator")\* (1 Incomplete)
*   1 [Gravity Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator")
*   14 [Gyroscopes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") (4 Incomplete)
*   4 Hydrogen Tanks (2 Full, 2 Incomplete)

\*Note that the O2/H2 Generators are named Oxygen Generators due to the name being updated after the ship was built.

## Behavior

The ship has 4 functional [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block"), 2 of which are used for the MAYDAY signal, whereas the other 2 loop each other to control 2 doors in the interior of it, the interior airlock door and the bridge door. The full cycle takes a total of 5 seconds, where the first timer block runs for 2 seconds and toggles the doors to the opposite state they were in. Since the ship spawns in with one of these doors closed and the other open, the timer always closes one and opens the other. Curiously the other timer block decreases the blink interval of the interior lights after a 3 second delay, despite them being turned off. The first timer also adjusts the blink by increasing it.

## Notes

*   The ship can be plausibly be reassembled despite the damage due to its symmetrical design, however, it would require a stockpile of materials and a ship that can reattach the right booster with merge blocks
*   Despite the encounter not being imbedded in voxels, all of it is a station. This can be easily fixed by going into the info panel of it and converting it to a ship
