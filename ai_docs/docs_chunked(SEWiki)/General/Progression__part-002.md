Thirdly, some imposed dependencies are quite arbitrary: Why do block weapons depend on landing gear, what if I'm starting in a base? Why do air vents depend on O2/H2 Generators, what if I need to urgently suck oxygen from a thin planetary atmosphere into my cockpit for survival? Why do I need to build a tiny small-grid cargo container to be allowed to repair my Connector to recharge my large-grid ship?

## Can I repair a block placed by someone else?

If progression is on, the building restrictions are per player and per game.

If you encounter a block placed by NPCs or other players:

*   You can use only it if the [owners](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") give you or your faction permission.
*   You can always grind it down.
*   But you can only weld it back up if you have the block unlocked. (DLC ownership is another factor.)

This limitation has an impact on how you can approach early-game repairs, piracy, and salvaging, because you might not be able to hack or repair any late-game blocks on pirated ships yet.

## How can I tell which blocks I can currently build?

Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Toolbar Configuration](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar_Configuration "Toolbar Configuration") and look at the **Blocks** tab.

## How do I unlock missing blocks?

If a block is missing from your toolbar configuration, you have to weld up one of the blocks of the previous level(s) first!

Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Toolbar Configuration](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar_Configuration "Toolbar Configuration") and look at the **Progression** tab, you’ll see a diagram of all blocks connected by lines.

*   By building any of the blocks on the first (left-most) level, you unlock dependent blocks of the second level. By building any blocks on the second level, you unlock dependent blocks of the third level. And so on, look at the indentation levels from left to right.

*   To find out how to unlock a specific block, enter its name in the **searchbar** to highlight the block in green. From it, follow the line to the left and up to the previous levels to know which blocks you need to unlock first.

**Important:** Use a handheld welder, not a utility ship with block welders, to be given credit for unlocking the block! It doesn’t matter who placed the block, only who hand-welded it.

## Which blocks are unlocked from the start?

First off, you can always build Armor Blocks.

Secondly, the blocks aligned with the left-most edge of the G-menu’s **Progression** tab are unlocked from the start:

*   Basic Assembler
*   Basic Refinery
*   O2/H2 Generator
*   Landing Gear
*   Cargo Container
*   Solar Panel and Wind Turbine
*   Interior wall

Build them to unlock the next levels.

## Do I have to build all blocks that are displayed in a row?

No! Blocks that are listed in the same “row” of the progression window are all unlocked together. (Long rows that contain more than a dozen blocks wrap like lines of text in a left-aligned paragraph.)

As far as unlocking the next level is concerned, all blocks in one row are equal alternatives what to build next. Weld up any _one_ of them to progress. After you have unlocked a row, you can add any or all of the blocks in that row to your [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar").

## Why can't I unlock/build these blocks that are marked with an icon?

Some optional blocks are only available if you have bought the respective [DLC Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC "DLC"). The [icon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC_and_Achievement_Icons "DLC and Achievement Icons") indicates which DLC the block is tied to.

Note: [Mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods") may also have their own conditions how their blocks are unlocked, which cannot be covered here.

## How Can I gain progress faster?

The fastest way is to switch off Progression in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

If you leave Progression enabled:

*   You don't need to place a block and weld it up from scratch to unlock the next level of progression. Grinding existing blocks on [Drop Pods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pods "Drop Pods") below the functional line, and then re-welding them, also advances progression!  
    Warning: **Do not grind down the [Drop Pods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pods "Drop Pods")' battery**, you won't be able to weld it up again without fresh [Power Cells](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power_Cell "Power Cell")!

*   In multiplayer, when you join a player faction, you often arrive at a base where all the entry-level blocks have already been built and are in use, which makes natural progression redundant.
    *   Ask a senior faction member to go to the [Factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") screen and share their progress with you.
    *   Afterwards, you can similarly offer to share your progress when onboarding new faction members.
    *   Players can only share the blocks they currently know. If you unlock more blocks later, you would need to share that knowledge separately.

*   In multiplayer, when lots of players join, senior faction members can build a row of unused entry point blocks (landing gear, solar panel, an empty small cargo container, an interior block, an unused o2/h2 generator, etc.) and let new members quickly grind and reweld the ones they haven’t unlocked yet. This allows new joiners to gain specific Progression fast without having to grind down blocks that are actively in use in the base, and without having to ask someone to share their Progression.

## What unlocks what?

Progression generally unlocks thematically related or dependent blocks, which makes it a bit easier to remember what unlocks what:

*   Algae Farm => Food production
*   Basic Refinery => Assembler, ore detectors, drills.
*   Basic Assembler => Assembler, batteries, lights, turrets, antenna, beacon.
*   Landing Gear => mobility blocks: wheel suspensions, cockpits, ion and atmo thrusters; also block tools and block weapons.
*   O2/H2 Generator => gas tanks, air vents, hydrogen engines, hydrogen thrusters.
*   Cargo Container => conveyors, sorters, connectors.
*   Power production blocks (solar panel, wind turbine) => mechanical blocks (hinges, rotors, pistons), merge blocks, beacons, doors.
*   Interior Block => all decorative and furniture blocks, including DLC.
*   Basic Assembler => light source => Automaton ([artificially intelligent](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence")) blocks.
