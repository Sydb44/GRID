# Safe Zone Skins - Official Space Engineers Wiki

By default,  [![Icon Block Safe Zone.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Safe_Zone.png/21px-Icon_Block_Safe_Zone.png?a32135)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone") [Safe Zone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone")s force fields have a hexagon grid.

A variety of force field designs are available as skin as part of the paid [Economy Deluxe Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy_Deluxe_Pack "Economy Deluxe Pack") DLC. The skins give no gameplay advantage and are purely aesthetic.
