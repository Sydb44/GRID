### Warfare 2 Update

For the Warfare 2 Update, a redesigned and modernised version of Big Blue called "Blue Corvette" was made with new thrusters and weapons. This ship appears in the [Asteroid Armory game start](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game").

The modernised version features four frontal static artillery weapons, a railgun, and two gatling turrets in the front. It also has autocannons under the rear, one in each thruster block. There are four conveyor tubes which have an open end in the central section, it is easy to fit additional turrets in there. It has a frontal connector which allows easy docking and entry from there. Another major difference from it's previous version is that the number of jump drives is doubled, increasing maximum jump range.

An interesting reference to the [Space Engineers alpha trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgxLikZX8HQ) is that the ship now features a large nuclear reactor instead of several small ones. In this trailer, the Blue Ship that is being welded, and then rammed, has a large reactor too, while the outdated version included in the game did not.

The modernised version can be used as a highly effective pirate attack vessel, both for attacks against NPC factions, and real players. Painting it in some darker, camouflage, color will make it very difficult to see with bare eyes. While unseen, you may fire a barrage from the artilleries and the railgun. The ship features powerful reverse thrusters, as did its outdated counterpart, so going full in reverse, disabling dampeners and making the enemy have to chase you is a very good battle plan. Maintain a distance of slightly less than two kilometers and fire artillery and railguns at the enemy ship. The enemy will not be able to fire back at you, as the projectiles stop after two kilometers, and you are moving away from it, so they will explode before hitting you. If you maintain distance at about 1.5 kilometers, a hit with missiles and gatling turrets is possible, but this brings you in the range of enemy artilleries and railguns.

### Signal Update

The newest version is [Blue Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blue_Ship "Blue Ship").

## Notes

*   There is a control group set up by default called \*Door\* which contains all of the doors in the ship.
*   All inventories are attached to the ship's [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"), with the exception of the Interior Turret, which is incompatible.
