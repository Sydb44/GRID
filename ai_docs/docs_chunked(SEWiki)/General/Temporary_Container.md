# Temporary Container - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![Temporary Containers textured.jpg](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Temporary_Containers_textured.jpg/320px-Temporary_Containers_textured.jpg?9ede7a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Temporary_Containers_textured.jpg)

In the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), you have the option to enable Temporary Containers.

When a cargo container (or any block with inventory) is destroyed, the items in it spill out. On servers, too many floating items can cause lag. If Temporary Containers are enabled, floating items are gathered together into small temporary containers, which improves performance.

The Temporary Container has a large variant when large-grid blocks are broken, and a small variant when small-grid containers are broken. The smaller version fits within the space of a small grid block, ensuring the Temporary Container can spawn safely and will not intersect and be ejected at great speed.

## How to pick up a temporary container

You do not pick up Temporary Containers by pressing [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") like an item. Instead, aim the crosshair at them, press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and drag and drop the container inventory into your player inventory. Then the empty Temporary Container disappears.

To transport it whole, pick it up using a tug ship or any vehicle using a magnetic [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear").

If a Temporary Container is in the area of effect of a [Collector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector"), the items go into the collector and the empty Temporary Container disappears. If the target inventory is full, a partially filled Temporary Container stays behind.
