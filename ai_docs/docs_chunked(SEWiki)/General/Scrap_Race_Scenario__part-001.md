# Scrap Race Scenario - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![The wasteland scrap race on planet Pertam](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Wasteland-scrap-race.png/320px-Wasteland-scrap-race.png?d2b218)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Wasteland-scrap-race.png)

Welcome to the infamous scrap race on planet Pertam!

Invite up to eight friends with nerves of steel to compete in the thrilling car races on the dangerous desert world [Pertam](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pertam "Pertam")!

The [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") was released together with the Wasteland Update and showcases explorable wrecks and decorative Wasteland DLC blocks. Owning the DLC is not required to play the Scrap Race.

## Should I play it?

There is no tutorial, but since vehicles are provided and the waypoints and laps are clearly marked, this scenario is suitable for any player who has learned the basics from [The First Jump Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_First_Jump_Scenario "The First Jump Scenario").

## Lobby

In this [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario"), players start in the Racer Lounge (lobby) at the rusty but charming Recycled Racer Bar. The maximum number of racers is eight, but more players can join as audience. There is no minimum player requirement for the game to start, one player can do trial runs on their own.

The Lobby offers a medical room where you can [customize](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Screen "Character Screen") your [space suit color](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Skins "Skins") if desired.

The Lobby is immune to damage, players cannot grind it for parts nor break out of it. Four minutes after the first player joins the lobby, each of the (up to eight) players is teleported into a garage.

## Preparation phase

Scrap race - Push a button to select a prebuilt race car in the garage

In your garage, you get three minutes to prepare during which you cannot leave.

*   Push one of the provided buttons to spawn one of four armed race cars: Scrap Rod, Dune Scout, Viper, Dune Enforcer.
*   Alternatively, experienced players could push the fifth button to obtain a blank chassis to build a custom car -- but then you must finish building very quickly, within the time limit.
*   Careful: Pushing multiple buttons replaces the previous car, and you lose any customisations. There can be only one car at a time in each garage.

All prebuilt cars come with a gatling gun and a missile turret. Don't worry about ammo, it will be provided! One of the two gyros of each prebuilt car is set to a Zero RPM Override for stabilization.

### Customize the car

Behind each car in the garage is a container with components and tools for you to use if you optionally wish to modify any car. Although [Storage Shelves](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Storage_Shelf "Storage Shelf") can usually be ground down to get the stored components, the scenario disallows that, so the shelves are only decorations.

> The provided cars are built on Pertam and are especially robust. Don't admin-paste in your own cars, they will hardly last to the end of the race! The rules of the game are that you must use or modify one of the provided chassis.

Modify this provided car chassis if you want to build a custom racecar

### Prepare for the race

Sit in the driver seat and familiarise yourself with the [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar"). The default turret AI settings are wasting ammunition, so you may want to [reconfigure them](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") and assign e.g. the AI on/off toggle to a toolbar slot.

Set up the car's toolbar, configure cockpit options (e.g. [Target Locking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Target_Locking "Target Locking") and [LCD scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Panels "LCD Panels")) and your preferred wheel settings, [repaint](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color") the car â€” or just keep the defaults. If you intend to stop and make emergency repairs mid-race, the garage is your last chance to pick up some spare parts.

## The race

When the three minutes are up, all garage doors open. There's a bar in front of the exit ramps, wait for it to pull back.

1.  Jump into your car and drive out onto the planet surface.
2.  Cycle [TAB key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and [H key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") until you see cyan checkpoint signals.
3.  Tip: Press [V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle between first and third person view.
4.  Head for the first highlighted **Starting Checkpoint**, then race for each of the subsequent Checkpoints, until you are back at the finish line.

It's well within the rules for you to disable the pesky competition with well targetted shots or by ramming -- just as your fellow racers will not hesitate to blast you out of the race at the first opportunity. Limited ammunition will be made available to your car after the race commences.

Familiarize yourself with the toolbar controls of your car:

*   Press toolbar slot [1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to enable the front-facing static gatling gun. Click to shoot forward while driving.
*   Press toolbar slot [2 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to manually control the top-mounted turret (use the mouse to aim and click to shoot). You can still use the WASD keys to steer, but if you're aiming the turret backwards, you won't see where you are going. Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to leave turret control and return to your normal driving view.
*   If you flip the car, use toolbar slot [3 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"): **Car Flip** uses a gyroscope override to make the car roll (hopefully) back onto its wheels. Then toggle [3 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") off again to drive on.

The game is timed. If you're too slow, you get teleported back to the start. In the end it will show everyone who won, and then the race will reset.
