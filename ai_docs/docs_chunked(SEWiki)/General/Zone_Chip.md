"Zone Chips! We're rich!"

Zone chips are an essential ingredient to build [Safe Zone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone") generators, and are also required as "fuel" to stabilise the force field long-term. One chip is expended upon use every time you start the Safe Zone.

## Port size

On small [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid"), Zone Chips fit through small [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port").

## Recipe

The engineers don't know the assembler recipe for zone chips since the NPC traders are keeping it secret.

In a vanilla Survival world, the only "legal" way to obtain Zone Chips is to purchase them at neutral or friendly [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"). The average price for Zone Chips is 112,000 Space credits. The fact that they cannot be manufactured by players makes trading them very valuable in multiplayer. The might also be loot.

Server Administrators (and anyone in singleplayer creative mode) can create Zone Chip items using the [Spawn Menu](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spawn_Menu "Spawn Menu").
