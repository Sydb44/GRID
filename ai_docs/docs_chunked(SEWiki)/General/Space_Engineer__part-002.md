Health can be negatively impacted by [discharges from weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") such as handguns, rifles, automatic turrets, and rocket launchers. Tools like the [Welder](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder "Welder") and [Grinder](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder "Grinder"), if used on other players, double as melee weapons or traps. High speed collisions with the ground, asteroids, other players, and grids are another source of often [lethal damage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death").

The player can survive without a helmet in a warm and oxygenated environment, such as a [pressurized](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") room or the [Earthlike](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Earth_Planet "Earth Planet") planet. Outside an atmosphere, players slowly suffocate if they run out of oxygen or open their helmets. In space, on moons, and on extreme planets, suit energy is continuously consumed to maintain a suitable [environment](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Environment "Category:Environment") for the engineer.

Using tools such as the hand drill, welder, and grinder, increases power consumption, causing the suit to run out of energy at an increased rate. The [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") warns you in red text once the suit reaches critical levels of 20% or less, providing the player with time to find a Cockpit or Medical Room to recharge [Life Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support"). If the suit power reaches 0%, the player's handheld tools and life support will no longer function!

Once health reaches 0%, players are considered [dead](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death"); they drop their backpack and are prompted to respawn. You can force your character to respawn without inventory by pressing [BACKSPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

You respawn at the closest faction-owned (or your own, if factionless) [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit") or [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room"). Depending on the auto-respawn [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), you may instead be allowed to pick a respawn point from a list.

## Player Inventory

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/Backpack2.png?b126e6)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Backpack2.png)

Backpack with built-in jetpack from behind

While not seated in a cockpit or seat, the player can access their personal inventory by pressing [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). With "Realistic" [settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), players can hold a total volume of 400L of items in their backpack.

In [multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer"), engineers can [trade](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Trading "Player Trading") items with nearby engineers from their inventories using [F3 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

Even though you stay the same player on each server, your personal inventories are separate and are not transferable between save games.

## Player Controls

## Trivia

Upon [creating a new game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_game "New game"), your Space Engineer always spawns on the dayside of the planet (if applicable).
