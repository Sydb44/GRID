# Inventory - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The **Inventory** tab in the [Terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal") gives the [Space Engineers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer") access to [Items](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item") carried...

*   either in their personal backpacks,
*   or in any block that has an inventory that they are interacting with, such as [cargo containers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cargo_Container "Cargo Container").

## Usage

You open your personal inventory while standing by pressing [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). For block inventories, sit in a seat, or stand and target an access [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") on a grid and then press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). You can also access the Inventory screen while seated by pressing [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and then opening the Inventory tab.

## How to store items

To grab a floating item (ores, rocks, components), press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). This places the item from the environment into the space engineer's personal inventory.

To deposit [components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component"), [materials](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material"), and [ores](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ore "Ore") from your player inventory quickly into a cargo container, [ALT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") click the cargo port. Conveniently, this does not deposit [consumables](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Consumable "Consumable") and [tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool "Tool"). For quality-of-life details, see also [Build Planner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Build_Planner "Build Planner").

In [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"), the inventory is limited in two fashions: Volume (represented in liters, "L") and Mass (represented in Kilograms, "kg"). When the total volume has been reached, then the player or the container can no longer accept any more items.

You can change the inventory volume size per game save in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

## How to drop items

Build Planner buttons in Inventory Screen

Drag unwanted items onto the **Drop** icon in the center of the Inventory screen to dispose of them into the world. Only items in the players personal Inventory can be dropped this way. Items will be dropped as a stack; e.g. dropping ores, stone, or ice creates a boulder that scales in size with how much of it you dropped â€” be careful in narrow spaces that the boulder doesn't squash you!

Dropped items are called "floating objects" by the game. Having too many of them in the world can slow down performance, but they can be deleted automatically when there are too many of them; see [World Settings#Max objects](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings#Max_objects "World Settings").

## Which blocks have inventory space

Many blocks such as [Small](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Cargo_Container "Small Cargo Container") / [Medium](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medium_Cargo_Container "Medium Cargo Container") / [Large Cargo Containers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Cargo_Container "Large Cargo Container"), [Parachute hatch](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Parachute_Hatch "Parachute Hatch"), [Small](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Reactor "Small Reactor") and [Large Reactor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Reactor "Large Reactor"), [O2/H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator"), [Block Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons"), [Hydrogen Engine](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Engine "Hydrogen Engine"), [Collector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector"), [Ejector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ejector "Ejector"), [Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector"), [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler"), and [Refinery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery") have their own inventory space, as well as conveyor [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") to connect to one another. It is recommended to connect them to the [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") for ease of access.

## How to transfer items between player <-> station <-> ship

For you to be able to drag and drop items between different inventories in the inventory screen, they must be [connected through the conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") and not be size or type restricted ([see](#Item_Size_Restrictions) [below](#Item_Type_Restrictions)).

The Inventory tab has two columns. For each side you have two choices:

*   Show character inventory, or
*   Show connected inventory (on ships or stations)

By default, you see the engineer's inventory on the left side, and the current grid's inventory on the right side.

Having two columns allows you to drag and drop items from one conveyored inventory to another. If you click **show connected inventories** on either side, you can move items from one container to another, drop off loot, exchange oxygen bottles, or unload a connected ship. Simply scroll each side so you see the respective containers, or use the filters.
