For example, it's smart to add hydrogen thrusters to an atmospheric or ion ship; shuttles are often hybrid so they can transition between space and atmosphere. But this means that the ship's specialisation is now "having boosters". Since you need to carry extra hydrogen tanks, you'll have less available capacity for additional specialisations.

## What's the difference between Center of Mass and Grid Pivot?

[![pivot point vs center of mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Center-of-mass-versus-pivot.png/320px-Center-of-mass-versus-pivot.png?bc0748)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Center-of-mass-versus-pivot.png)

When you add blocks, the pivot point stays, but the center of mass changes.

The first block that you place becomes the [Grid Pivot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid_Pivot "Grid Pivot") of the new grid. The pivot block is the one around which the grid rotates when you paste it in Creative Mode, or when you [project](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") it in Survival Mode.

The pivot is _not_ the same as the [Center of Mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Center_of_Mass "Center of Mass"). The center of mass is the point around which the ship rotates when pitching/yawing/rolling while flying.

To see the pivot point and CoM of grids highlighted, use the [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen").
