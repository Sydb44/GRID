# Space Engineers Wiki:Styling Guide - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Thank you for [contributing](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineers_Wiki:Contributors "Space Engineers Wiki:Contributors") updates and new content for the community! When editing existing pages or adding new ones, please stick to the following editing guidelines.

Please be polite and constructive. Don't use the wiki to advertise. In case of doubt, follow the existing style and heading structure of similar pages.

If any formatting is unclear, don't worry about it, leave a comment on the Discussion tab and an admin will help you. Or ask directly in the Wiki channel on Keen's Discord.

## Guidelines

**Space Engineers Wiki.gg Styling Guidelines** are to help keep consistency in style throughout the site as well give rules on the use of pages.

Contributors should not be intimidated by the guidelines. They are here to help the more serious contributors and help quell disputes. Making a mistake or two is fine and will not result in a ban or other punishment. Users should assume good faith and politely fix or report the issue. Chances are that any mistake will be fixed by the next person to see the page with no grief.

## All Pages

The following guidelines generally apply to all pages in the "Article" namespace, regardless of page type or subject. Some exceptions are made for top level pages and the Main Pages.

### Attribution

As with all information everywhere, and always, contributors should attribute sources and know that anything posted here is automatically released under the [CC-BY-SA Licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

### Language Preferences

Use the spelling that the game uses, that means, American English preferred.

### Professional Writing

*   Write clearly and unambiguously. Don't introduce more than one new concept in a sentence.

*   Use a clear, active or imperative style when describing tasks:
    *   Avoid: ~After pasting the script, it should compile~.
    *   Prefer: Paste the script and compile it.
*   Gender Specific: Avoid "him/his/he, her/hers/she" when not talking about an individual. It is easier to use plural, for example: "Players log on to their games", "engineers crashed their ships", "automatons help them", and so on.
*   English Contractions are acceptable, but writing out the words looks better.
*   Avoid cultural references: [Cliches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliches), [Colloquialisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialisms), [Catchphrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase) and other [Popular Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Culture) references. An international audience will use this site to find information on Space Engineers. Using cultural references may make understanding more difficult for them and potentially mislead or even offend.

### Page Creation

*   This Wiki will be using a standard to include the headings **References** and **See also** on **all** article pages. Please include these headings, even if they are temporarily published empty.
    *   **References** shall include any sources referred to in the article, cited in the appropropriate place. Any quotes shall be wrapped in speech marks ("").
    *   **See also** shall include any sources not specifically used in the article, but are related to the article and so may be of further use to the player.
*   Singular vs plural _\-_ singular preferred in titles where possible.
*   Proper Capitalization: All words are Capitalized, except articles (a, an, the)
*   Intentional use of redirect pages _\-_ Redirect pages are fine where appropriate to do so. However, these may be removed at administrator's discretion_._
*   Category page use _\-_ category pages may include information where appropriate, such as [Category:Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Blocks "Category:Blocks"). If you discover a page that is outdated, please add it to the [Category:Updateme](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Updateme "Category:Updateme").

### Linking

*   To link to another article inside Space Engineers Wiki.gg, place double square brackets about the word to be linked (\[\[ \]\]).
    *   **Example:** \[\[Space Engineer\]\] will produce [Space Engineer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer")
*   Link no more than necessary.
*   Do not link terms linked in info boxes... they are already linked.
*   Link terms that may be used in specific ways in-game, especially if they have another meaning out of the game.
*   To link an article to an external site place single square brackets about the "URL" and space, then the text to be displayed to be linked (\[ \]). External links will show up as blue with a box and arrow.
    *   **Example:** \[http://www.google.com google\] will produce [google](https://www.google.com/)
*   If an article does not exist by the given name, or if a URL is invalid, the link will show up as dark red, like this.
*   Interwiki prefixes are enabled on both Space Engineers wikis. For example, a link to spaceengineers2.wiki.gg/wiki/SE1:Blocks gets redirected to spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blocks. And vice versa.

*   Use proper capitalization.
*   Avoid other styling like bolding, underlining, and italicizing in headers.
*   Make all Headers unique, regardless of level (this is for linking sake, e.g. \[\[Page Name#Header\]\]).
*   Avoid punctuations and special characters (again, this is for linking sake).
*   Headings should not normally contain links, especially where only part of a heading is linked.
*   Headings should not explicitly refer to the subject of the article, or to higher-level headings, unless doing so is shorter or clearer.
*   Headings should be descriptive and in a consistent order.
*   Headings should be nested sequentially:
    *   the automatically generated top-level heading of a page is H1, which gives the article title;
    *   primary headings are then ==H2==, ===H3===, ====H4====, and so on until the lowest-level heading ======H6======.
    *   headings should be nested sequentially, neither using random heading levels (e.g. selected for emphasis, which is not the purpose of headings), nor skipping parts of the sequence.
