## Easter Egg (Spoiler)

In the research archives, you can find a small conference room where the LED panels show references to the three in-game scenarios that are connected to the [Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)"):

*   R.O.S. Division appears in the [The First Jump Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_First_Jump_Scenario "The First Jump Scenario")
*   R.O.S. Sunset Valley Task Force alludes to the [Lost Colony Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lost_Colony_Scenario "Lost Colony Scenario")
*   R.O.S. Triton Task Force refers to the setting of the Frostbite Scenario

## Tips and recommendations (Spoilers)

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

The planet Triton has low levels of oxygen, so pay attention to where you are able to breathe, and open and close your helmet accordingly to save suit oxygen. In certain areas of the map, buildings are located above the breathable atmosphere level, so an oxygen bottle will be needed to investigate said areas.

Always have a survival kit and a gatling turret on the vehicle you are using, and optimally a backup survival kit or medical room somewhere protected at major locations.

Since jetpacks are disabled, use drones to ferry your team members around. Repair the provided drones and rovers (or build your own) and expand their cargo, transport, and defense capabilities in your favour.
