The  [![Icon Block Collector.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Collector.png/21px-Icon_Block_Collector.png?e28170)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector") Collector is a functional [block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block") in Space Engineers used to collect floating [Items](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item") and place them into a grid inventory. Think of it as a vacuum cleaner for floating [ores](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ores "Ores"), [food](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food"), and dropped [components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component").

## Usage

In contrast to a [Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector"), a Collector does not need faction permissions, docking, or sharing of inventories to accept items. Items have no ownership, so as long as the Collector is switched on, it accepts anything.

Usage examples are:

*   Harvesting ripe [food](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food") from [Farm Plots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Farm_Plot "Farm Plot")
*   Picking up forageables in world
*   a collector drone flying through a debris field to pick up ammunition or loot.

Tip: Use a [Ejector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") to eject all collected items that you don't want to keep.

The Collector alone only pulls in items that are right within its small area of effect. For its function as a "space vacuum cleaner", the Collector is typically combined with a [Gravity Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator") that pulls items towards it from a wider radius. On both planets and in space, a ship with an [Ejector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") can propel items in the Collector's direction. On planets, upwards facing Collectors can use planetary gravity to collect, for example, ores or components that are dropped by players or ejectors from above.

The Collector cannot pick up _blocks_, for that you need a [Grinder Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_Block "Grinder Block").

Regarding automation, an Event Controller cannot detect crops in a Farm Plot, but it can detect that a collector's inventory has picked up a food item.

## Inventory

With Realistic settings, the Collector has an inventory with a capacity of 1,675L on small ships and 6,250L on large ships and stations. The inventory accepts all items, allowing it to gather any [ores](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ores "Ores"), [components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component"), and [materials](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material") floating in space.

If attached to a [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"), the collector is flagged to send pulled items to other blocks. It will automatically push its contents to valid inventories, such as cargo containers or Refineries.[\[1\]](http://forums.keenswh.com/post/show_single_post?pid=1282594029&postcount=1)

## Power

The Collector consumes 2 kW when placed on small ships, large ships, and stations. This value remains the same, regardless of whether or not it has items to collect.

## Construction

The block is 1x1x1 blocks in size on large grid and 3x3x3 on small grid. The yellow hopper-shaped upper side must be kept freely accessible, so put it facing the outside, towards the floating items.

When placing the large-grid block, note that the one port on the underside must connect to a conveyor port. This is its only attachment point.

When harvesting Farm Plots, the Collector cannot be on the same grid. Either attach the Collector as [subgrid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Subgrid "Subgrid") through a rotor, hinge, or piston to the Farm Plot grid, or use collectors on separate grids (that is, mobile rovers or drones).

When placing the small grid variant (SG), consider that small grid uses two conveyor port sizes that have an impact on what you can collect and how bulky your collector ship will be: Two of the sides can connect to _large SG_ conveyor ports (which are bulky but can convey all items), while the underside and two other sides offer three _small SG_ conveyor ports (typically used for drones that focus on collecting e.g. ores). For details on what fits through the small SG conveyor ports, see [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system").
