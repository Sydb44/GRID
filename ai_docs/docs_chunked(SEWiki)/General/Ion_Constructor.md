This small [pre-built](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Built_Ship "Pre-Built Ship") [repair/builder](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") vessel is intended for short-term use in space only; it has no life support it is not capable of atmospheric flight.

## Description

You can obtain this ship in game from [trading space stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") that are owned by a [builder faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions"). The expensive ion thrusters make this a worthy buy for a utility spacecraft for less than 10,000,000 space credits. It comes with fully charged large batteries.

This vessel can be a great support vessel, but it would be a poor first choice when used by a sole Space Engineer. To be able to restock its inventory to fulfill large repair [contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts"), this small-grid vessel still requires separate component manufacturing support, such as a space station, a moon base, or mothership.

The connector allows it to refill its inventory fast which increases its value as a [constructor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") type ship.

Its limitations are its weak small ion thrusters: Since constructor ships do slow precision work close up, they are typically heavy, and accelerate and brake sluggishly. Since it lacks dedicated life support, the builders guild recommends pilots to stock the cockpit inventory with spare oxygen bottles. Optimally, a faster ship carries the Ion Constructor to the construction site.
