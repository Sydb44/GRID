The **Passenger Seat** is a block which allows players to be seated on small ships, large ships, and stations, much like a cockpit, with access to the grid's [Terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal").

## Usage

Sitting in a seat recharges the engineers' suits power, but refills neither oxygen nor hydrogen. Unlike cockpits, these seats do not give players control over the ship's movement nor access to the grids inventories. The only elements available on the [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") config screen while seated are [Emotes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Emotes "Emotes") and [Chat](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Chat "Chat"). If you are within antenna range, you can open the [Remote Access Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Access_Screen "Remote Access Screen") to access [Remote Controled](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") grids.

## Construction

Passenger Seats have an inventory of 1000L and no conveyor access. From update 1.200 on, the size of the small-grid Passenger Seat was narrowed from 3x3x3 to 2x3x3. A second matching **Offset Passenger Seat** was added for small grid ships which is not centered on a block. They can be used together to build offset rows of chairs.
