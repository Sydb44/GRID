[![Unidentified Signal.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/3/38/Unidentified_Signal.png/320px-Unidentified_Signal.png?463ec9)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Unidentified_Signal.png)

An orange signal on your HUD that says “Unidentified Signal” marks a [Global Encounter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Global_Encounters "Global Encounters"). Do not mistake it for a simple [Unknown Signal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unknown_Signals "Unknown Signals"). Approach carefully.

They despawn after a while and a new one will appear. If one is too far away to reach, simply wait for a closer one.

In multiplayer, all players can see the Unidentified Signals, so expect other players to join in the event as well.
