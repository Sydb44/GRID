[![SOTF Shuttle](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/3/3e/SOTF_Shuttle.jpg/320px-SOTF_Shuttle.jpg?2e0c0f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:SOTF_Shuttle.jpg)

The small-grid shuttle commutes between the two outer [asteroids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid") of the [Sparks of the Future](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sparks_of_the_Future_Scenario "Sparks of the Future Scenario") [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario").

Passengers can enter through doors on either side. The stark interior has two passenger seats and offers some refreshments. The cabin has an oxygen tank, and O2/H2 generator, and an air vent to provide a breathable atmosphere during the trip. Timers and depressurising Air Vent ensure that no oxygen is wasted.

For its flight, the Shuttle uses several [Ion Thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ion_Thruster "Ion Thruster") and three [Gyroscopes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope"). The unoccopied cockpit control seat is behind a separate door. The [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") block's [Autopilot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Autopilot "Autopilot") takes the shuttle back and forth between the outer two asteroids where it commutes following a series of fixed waypoints.[Timer Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block")\- and Autopilot-controlled actions switch autopilot on/off, spotlights on/off, vent depressurize on/off, doors open/close, and then restart the timers.

The programmable block is only decorational.
