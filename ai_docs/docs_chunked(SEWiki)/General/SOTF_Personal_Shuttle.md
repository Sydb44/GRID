# SOTF Personal Shuttle - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![SOTF Personal Shuttle](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/SOTF_Personal_Shuttle.jpg/320px-SOTF_Personal_Shuttle.jpg?612b9d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:SOTF_Personal_Shuttle.jpg)

This small-grid personal shuttle can be found on the central asteroid of the [Sparks of the Future](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sparks_of_the_Future_Scenario "Sparks of the Future Scenario") [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario"). It is either parked behind an airlock under one of the rail overpasses where you change from the red to the blue line (on the other side of the air lock is an outside landing pad), or on a private roof landing pad in Hotel Argon.

This tiny stylish hoverbike-style ship has one seat, several ion thrusters, a gyroscope, a landing gear, and three small reactors. Tired of waiting for the tram? This Shuttle is your perfect private vehicle to get around quickly on an asteroid base.
