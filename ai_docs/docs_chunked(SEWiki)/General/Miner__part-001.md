# Miner - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The Miner is a [Pre-Built Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Built_Ship "Pre-Built Ship") that is included when creating a new world from the [_Red Ship_ template](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content#Red_Ship "Original Content").

## Description

This lightweight and compact Miner has a mass of 12,149 kg. It saves weight by using hardly any armor, which also makes it more fragile than other ships. It's not easy to get into the cockpit from the front, and when you are in, your view is very limited. On the other hand, its super compact design has the advantage that the miner can drill holes that it can fly through without breaking off parts.

Its slenderness has the side effect that it has room for only one  [![Icon Block Medium Cargo Container.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/c/ce/Icon_Block_Medium_Cargo_Container.png/21px-Icon_Block_Medium_Cargo_Container.png?5e0039)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medium_Cargo_Container "Medium Cargo Container") [Medium Cargo Container](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medium_Cargo_Container "Medium Cargo Container"), which is the minimum for an effective miner. It has no room for  [![Icon Block Landing Gear.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/2/2d/Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png/21px-Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png?d381be)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") [Landing Gears](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") either, but you can add slender [Magnetic Plates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Plate "Magnetic Plate"), if desired.

It comes with four  [![Icon Block Small Reactor.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/2/23/Icon_Block_Small_Reactor.png/21px-Icon_Block_Small_Reactor.png?64124d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Reactor "Small Reactor") [Small Reactors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Reactor "Small Reactor") and only one  [![Icon Block Battery.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/1/13/Icon_Block_Battery.png/21px-Icon_Block_Battery.png?fc3f6b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery") [Battery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery"). Two of the reactors are however not conveyored, so you need to refuel them manually; they are easily accessible at both sides of the battery. The Battery's maximum power output is 1.00 MW, and it has a fuel time of four days when idle.

The back side features a convenient  [![Icon Block Connector.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/7c/Icon_Block_Connector.png/21px-Icon_Block_Connector.png?30a126)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") [Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") for a fast ore offloading, and for recharging the battery off a larger ship's connector. This entry-level Miner does not have ejectors to drop stone and focus on ores, and it is difficult to add [Small Conveyor Sorters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Conveyor_Sorter "Small Conveyor Sorter") paired with [small ejectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Connector "Small Connector") yourself without increasing its compact profile.

It comes with an  [![Icon Block O2 H2 Generator.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/7e/Icon_Block_O2_H2_Generator.png/21px-Icon_Block_O2_H2_Generator.png?60936f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") [O2 H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator"), allowing it to venture further and letting the pilot refill oxygen and hydrogen bottles from ice found on route. Its  [![Icon Block Antenna.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/3/36/Icon_Block_Antenna.png/21px-Icon_Block_Antenna.png?35ae0b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna") [Antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna") signals its name, "Miner", at a distance of 500 m, so don't jetpack away further before increasing the broadcasting range. Also be careful not to snap off the antenna against an asteroid.
