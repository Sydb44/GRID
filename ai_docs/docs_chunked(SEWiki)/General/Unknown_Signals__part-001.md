A cargo drop falling with an opened parachute

Unknown Signals are mysterious cargo drops on parachutes that appear periodically in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") near players. This feature can be disabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

They are distinguished from “known” (named) [Signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal") and [Unidentified Signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unidentified_Signals "Unidentified Signals").

Unfortunately, Unknown Signals do not spawn in the console release of the game. If you would like them, please [create a feedback ticket](https://support.keenswh.com/spaceengineers/xbox/topic/add) and gather as many votes as possible.

## Usage

It’s your choice if you want to hunt them down: There are no consequences for ignoring them and no risks in looting them. A few of them have "surprises", but none of them is dangerous to players. When you urgently need repair components, they can be a lifesaver.

## Countdown

Unknown Signals have a despawn timer that appears as e.g. a "T - 15 minutes" [signal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal") on the [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"). The indicator does NOT mean that it’s "a 15-minute's walk away", NOR that you will get loot "after 15 mins". It means that you are given 15 minutes to reach it and loot it, and the self-destruct timer is counting down.

### Why am I hearing explosions?

If you ever hear a random explosion but see no impact, it was likely an Unknown Signal despawning. When the countdown reaches zero, the cargo drop self-destructs with an audible explosion. The self destruct does not damage players nor voxel terrain nor other grids than itself.

The self-destruct is tied to the cargo drop's grid! The explosion will also happen if you [hack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking") or [claim](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Claim_NPC_Ship "Claim NPC Ship") the grid or take it with you, for example, if you take the cargo drop's battery whole to discharge it. These things wont happen if you already pressed the button.

Tip: The only way to disrupt the self destruct is to [merge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block") the captured blocks to a small-grid that is owned by yourself and that is made up of _more blocks_ (!) than the cargo drop.

## Appearance

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/Unknown-signal.png?5c726a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Unknown-signal.png)

The standard cargo drop is a small, roundish, unpropelled craft built out of small-grid Light Armor blocks.

When encountered on planetary surfaces, the parachute will deploy and the cargo drop will slowly float down. When encountered in space or on moons, the canvas has not been used and can be looted.

It will always at least be built of the following parts:

*   At least 1 [Button Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Button_Panel "Button Panel"), possibly also dummy button panels
*   [Parachute Hatch](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Parachute_Hatch "Parachute Hatch") supplied with [Canvas](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Canvas "Canvas")
*   [Small Cargo Container](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Cargo_Container "Small Cargo Container") or [Medium Cargo Container](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medium_Cargo_Container "Medium Cargo Container")
*   [Small Battery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Battery "Small Battery")
*   [Antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna")

Click to view spoiler

Some cargo drops also have thrusters, gyroscopes, and sensors. Their passive defensive abilities include the programming to run away from players. You will need to hunt these cargo drops down and disable them before you can interact with them -- and before they accidentally destroy themselves by crashing into things.
