# Plugins - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![Avaness-SE-Plugin-Loader.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/Avaness-SE-Plugin-Loader.png?6e7b15)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Avaness-SE-Plugin-Loader.png)

Plugins are a type of Space Engineers customization for the PC platform.

Their access to your PC, the game world, and generic programming of features is unrestricted, which means they can add complex and advanced gameplay. At the same time, incompatible or malicious plugins cannot only crash or slow down the whole game, but also access your files or network! Only use plugins if you understand their risk, and:

Install plugins only from trusted sources, and upload them only to the community repository!

  
For the full official statement on plugin support, see [spaceengineersgame.com/plugins](https://www.spaceengineersgame.com/plugins/).

Until 2023, plugins were possible to load directly to the game, although not officially recognized by Keen Software House. They were not intended for the community to use, but for Keen's own tools. To increase safety, Keen has removed this support, as well as all plugins from the Steam Workshop and Mod.io and will not allow new uploads there.

Community members such as Avaness have created a **community plugin repository on GitHub**. Community contributors must upload their plugin code where it is transparent and open source. The community plugin repository for Plugin Loader is also available to view on the [project's website](https://sepluginloader.github.io/hub).

## How to Install the Plugin Loader

Previous versions of the game allowed the use of the plugins via [custom launch options](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/7D01-D2DD-D75E-2955), but now one of the only ways to install plugins is to use the Space Engineers Launcher for Plugin Loader. This launcher is a community-supported tool by Avaness that will start the game with Plugin Loader. Plugin Loader will download and keep plugins up to date using the community GitHub repository. Find more information on how to install it on the [project's website](https://sepluginloader.github.io/download).

## How to install plugins

Plugins are not added to individual game worlds like [mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods"), instead they are added to the whole SE game. Be prepared that installing plugins will also slow down the startup time of the whole game.

1.  Start the Space Engineers Launcher. (Not the one from Steam!)
2.  In the main menu, click the **Plugins** button.
3.  Enable the plugins hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/austinvaness/PluginHub).
4.  Click Save.
5.  Click Restart.

The selected plugins are now available to all game worlds.

Tip: Again, don't install plugins from any other sources, they could be unsafe or buggy.

## Troubleshooting

If you have installed plugins and the game suddenly no longer starts, temporarily disable all plugins by holding [ESCAPE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") while the game is loading. Then report your issue to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/austinvaness/PluginHub) and work with the community to find a solution.

## Client or Server?

The plugin description will tell you whether the plugin must be installed clientside or serverside or both.

Plugins that are clientside-only also work (for you only) when you are playing on a multiplayer server. It's similar to how you could install colourful icons or ReShade[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) for _shinier_ visuals that only you can see, and the server wouldn’t care.

In order for plugins with any serverside aspects to work at all, it's up to the admin of the multiplayer server to install them, in addition to the players installing them clientside.
