        *   If SurpriseTimer was on, the "surprise" happens.
        *   If SurpriseTimer was off, nothing happens.

## Troubleshooting

### Auditory Troubleshooting: Beeps

A Timer Block has a setting to run either silently or to beep every time when triggered. Additionally, if you have set up a **Delay**, a non-**silent** Timer beeps for every second of the countdown. The sound is only audible in close proximity.

Which setting should you choose?

*   A silent timer is less annoying when it loops often. Silence is also preferred when actions are supposed to happen without attracting the attention of players.
*   Deactivating the **Silent** option can be useful, on the other hand, while setting it up or while troubleshooting, to get feedback. You can also use auditory feedback when you purposely want to alert other players to expect an automated action — reminds them to wait, for example, for an airlock sequence or a docking manoeuvre to complete.

### Visual Troubleshooting: Colours

The Timer block changes colour while it's running to show you its stages:

*   Green means the Timer is ready and powered.
*   During the Delay countdown, it alternates between cyan and blue.
*   Red means it's been switched off or has no power.

### Manual Troubleshooting

In the [control panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"), you can trigger the block manually.

*   Trigger Now -- Don't wait for the delay and play the actions.
*   Start -- Count down the delay and then play the actions.
*   Stop -- Stop the running actions.

This is the same start/stop action that can also be triggered remotely by another Timer block. Manual starting and stopping timers is useful during set-up and troubleshooting. If a block in a [mechanical](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") sequence gets damaged and stops moving, coordinated movements go out of sync; after the block has been repaired, all timers need to be stopped, reset, and restarted in the right order.

## Construction

If [progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is enabled, build any light first to unlock timers.

Timer blocks are cheap and can be built and used early on. You can build them on small grid and large grid, and they they have mount points on all six sides. When the block is switched on, it requires 0.1W of power, which is dismissible, as it is almost nothing -- a small battery can power 500 000 Timers for an hour.

The block has a coloured side that blinks while it’s active. You can rotate and purposefully hide that side of the blocks, or place a whole bunch of them in plain sight (perhaps with a [transparent LCD panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Transparent_LCD "Transparent LCD") as label) for a techy “blinking-lights control room” look.
