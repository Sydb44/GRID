It is revealed that decades before the start of the story, Sunset Valley was inhabited by the [Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") faction who built numerous bunkers and research facilites in the valley. They discovered a cavern containing an unknown fungus that eventually broke free, resulting in a complete lockdown of the research facility. At the same time, the R.O.S. fleet was defeated by an unknown opposing faction (possibly [AGI](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Argonaut_Industries "Argonaut Industries")?) and due to the surface bombardment, most facilities became buried under rubble and were forgotten, with the final survivors succumbing to the fungus in the buried research facility.

Years later, [AGI](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Argonaut_Industries "Argonaut Industries") built a colony in the valley, using an old bunker as the sewer system for their main settlement. However, the Zhangs were secretly tasked with locating the old R.O.S. facilities to track down a "biological agent", eventually repeating history. The fungus started spreading in the colony again, at first leading to people disappearing and dying by themselves. When panic erupted, the colonists destroyed all radio equipment and sabotaged the reactor in an attempt to contain the fungus in the valley and use the reactors radiation to destroy it. Sadly, everyone got infected and eventually died. One distress call however made it through, prompting the player to discover the truth about the colony's fate.

The final datapad that can be found contains the last words of R.O.S. Scientist Dr Saarijarvi:

> "If anyone finds this, I hope the journey was worth it. But I must ask you: Whoever you are, were you even ordered to go as far as to opening this place? Or did you forget your orders along the way?
> 
> If so, I'm sorry to tell you that this is the end for you, as it was for me. Maybe you will go on a bit longer and try to find something more to do, but eventually you will find a nice cozy place to take a break and become one with the valley.
> 
> Dr Saarijarvi signing off."

Finding this message means you have solved the mystery.
