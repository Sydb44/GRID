The Encounter Drone Facility (or droneyard?) is a large grid space station that can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is [enabled in your world](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"). It belongs to the "[Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates")" faction, and emits the "SPRT MAYDAY" beacon signal.

## Description

The station has an area with two "claws" in front that hold ships or drones in space while they are being welded.

## Spoilers

If you come close, the facility calls in defense drones until you destroy its antenna.
