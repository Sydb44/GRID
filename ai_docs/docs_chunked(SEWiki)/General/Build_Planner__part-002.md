### How to withdraw components

To withdraw components into the welder ship's cargo:

1.  Dock the ship to a connector of the conveyor system of the station/mothership.
2.  Press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the ship inventory.
    *   On the left side, filter to show the welder ship inventory only (target).
    *   On the right side, filter to show the base inventory only (source).
3.  To produce the queued components, click the **gear** button in the middle column.
4.  To deposit all components from the left (ship) into the right (base) inventory, click the **right-arrow** button in the middle column.
5.  To withdraw the produced components into your ship, click the **left-arrow** button in the middle column.

You can always hover the mouse over the Inventory buttons to read the tooltips to remind yourself what they do!

## How to check the queue and clean it up

When the whole order is completely withdrawn, the block disappears from the queue.

Are you not withdrawing what you expected? Did you use the modifier keys and queued too many or too few components? Then clean up the queue manually!

1.  How to open the Build Planner depends on whether you are sitting or standing:
    *   While seated in a grid with an Assembler, click the Build Planner button in the **[Production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production")** tab.

    *   While standing, check the build planner by pressing [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and looking in the bottom right of the [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar"). Hover the mouse over queued blocks to see the missing components.

## Caveats

It's more reliable to withdraw things across grids by using the inventory screen and clicking the buttons. The Build Planner loses track of your order when you are withdrawing through multiple grids.

For example, if you use the mouse-click shortcuts on a cargo port of a ship that is connected to a station that has the components in it, it often doesn't withdraw them[\[1\]](#cite_note-1). It also miscounts when it sees only some of the components in one cargo container, but not enough for your entire order.
