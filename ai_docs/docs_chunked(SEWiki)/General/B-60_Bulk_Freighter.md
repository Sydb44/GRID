## Description

You can obtain this cargo ship in game from the [NPC Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") that are owned by a [builder faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions"). Averaging around 400-500,366,784 space credits, this top-tier vessel's cost stems from the material cost of its large atmospheric thrusters and of course the Jump Drive.

The hybrid ship is additionally equipped with [hydrogen thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Thruster "Hydrogen Thruster"), allowing it to be suitable for space and planetary travel. Despite what the description says, the Medical Room is a hidden block conveyored in the spacecraft.

A peculiarity of the vessel is that it does not have a [Hydrogen Engine](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Engine "Hydrogen Engine") for battery power replenishment and It's braking hydrogen thrusters are hidden inside the nacelles.

The B-60 sits a respectable dry weight of 791,619 kg and has three large cargo containers.

## Trivia

The age of the vessel blueprint shows, as it uses primitive blocks as 'beds' and 'showers' from before the release of the [Decorative Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack "Decorative Pack") and [Decorative Pack 2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack_2 "Decorative Pack 2") DLCs.
