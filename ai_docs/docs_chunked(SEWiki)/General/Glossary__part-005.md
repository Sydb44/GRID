**Tug:** n. A common type of utility spaceship that is purpose-built for controlled dragging. It uses  [![Icon Block Landing Gear.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png/21px-Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png?d381be)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear"), magnetic plates, or rarely  [![Icon Block Gravity Generator.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Gravity_Generator.png/21px-Icon_Block_Gravity_Generator.png?9a1cf8)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator") [Gravity Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator")s as tools to stow cargo, haul salvage, or assist spaceships that cannot reach their berth by themselves.

## V

**Vanilla:** adj. A vanilla game is a game which has not been customized. The ideal vanilla world uses only standard planets, standard settings, no [mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods"), no [scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripts "Scripts"), no [plugins](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Plugins "Plugins"), no [DLCs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC_and_Achievement_Icons "DLC and Achievement Icons"), no [Experimental mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode"). It's the lowest common denominator that works for every user on every platform. For example, Keen [Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Support "Support") will typically ask you to reproduce a reported bug in a vanilla world to exclude the possibility that the issue is caused by a mod.

**Vector:** n. In layman’s terms, an arrow that has a start, a direction, and a length. In maths, a vector describes a position in space relative to a start position by telling you _in which direction_ and _how far_ you have to travel to get from one to the other, as the bird flies. Only used internally in the game, players simply use [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS"). Related example: "Thrust vectoring means controlling the direction and intensity of a rotating thruster."

**Ventral:** adj. Located on the bottom side of a spaceship or vehicle. Opposite of dorsal. Example: "If this shuttle had ventral lights, we could see how far away from the ground we are."

**Voxel:** n. The smallest element that a volumetric object is made of in 3D graphics. In game, asteroids, moons, and planets are made up of destructible voxels.

**VST:** n. The Visual Scripting Tool for Space Engineers is a [Scenario Editor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario_Editor "Scenario Editor") created by Keen Software House.

## W

**[Walker](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker"):** n. A large robot with android or animal features (that is, legs, arms, wings) that is controlled by a player from a cockpit inside. Also known as Mech(a).

**WASD:** n. The four most commonly used [keyboard keys](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to control a game character are W, A, S, and D. Example: "I use WASD to steer the starship, not a controller."

**Welder Wall:** n. An array of conveyored [welders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_Block "Welder Block") built so that a [projection](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") exposed to the combined area of effect is built fast. Also called Welder Pit. See also Collector Pit, Grinder Pit, and [3D Printer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer").

**The World Seam:** n. A geographical feature on SE planets, where an artificial looking vertical ridge line marks where the six cube maps are stitched together. There is often one latitudinal seam around each pole, and there can be four more longitudinal seams outside the polar regions.

## Y

**Yaw:** v. Rotation on the Y-axis, that is, turning left or right in a head shaking motion. See [gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope").
