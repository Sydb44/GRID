Warning Signs are decorative blocks that exist for large and small grid. Visually they are small flat poster-sized decorations that come in many variants.

Some Warning Signs were added in the paid [Automatons Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automatons_Pack "Automatons Pack") DLC and some in the free Warfare Evolution Update.

## Usage

Warning Signs are decoration that add a bit of life to a base or ship. In contrast to the editable text of LCDs, the signs' text is static and is visible farther away. Warning Signs also require only 1 PCU but on the other hand, are much smaller than the largest LCDs.

## Trivia

Marek Rosa, the founder of the independent game dev studio [Keen Software House](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Keen_Software_House "Keen Software House") that makes Space Engineers, owns a second company named GoodAI. The signs added in the Warfare Evolution Update advertise Marek Rosa's real-world software products in the game world. GoodAI develops an artificial general intelligence (AGI) called Badger that uses a method called memetics, in which multiple expert systems share pieces of information (memes) to collectively solve a task. See also [Good.Bot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Good.Bot "Good.Bot").

"Grid AI" was the working title of what was later released as the Automaton Update; the term "AI Grid blocks" refers to the [Automaton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automaton "Automaton") blocks.

## Construction

Warning Signs can be built on large and small grids. Their frame can be textured/colored.

Their placement is like the placement of interior lights in the sense that you cannot place them in mid air or drop them like many other blocks; you must attach them to a block surface.

### Warfare Evolution Update

The following artificial intelligence (AI)-themed warning signs were released as part of the free Warfare Evolution update and are available to everyone:

Blue:

*   Warning Sign Memetic Badger 1 - "Notice / Memory based Multi-Agent / Memetic Badger / Our units use an advanced AI architecture" with neural network logo

Green:

*   Warning Sign GoodAI - "Powered by GoodAI" with owl logo

Yellow:

*   Warning Sign Memetic Badger 2 - "Memetic Badger architecture" with badger face logo
*   Warning Sign Arrow - just a black arrow on yellow ground
*   Warning Sign Grid AI - "Warning / AI Grid Blocks / Advanced General AI in use" with large computer chip logo
*   Warning Sign AI Powered - "Caution / AI Powered" with small computer chip logo
