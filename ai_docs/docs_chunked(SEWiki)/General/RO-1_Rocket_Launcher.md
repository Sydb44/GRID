It's rocket launching time!

The RO-1 Rocket Launcher is a basic [player weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons") that shoots rockets. Looking at its recipe, this could be a mid-game weapon, but the bottleneck is that you must still recharge it with expensive [Rockets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") that require Uranium.

## Upgrades

It comes in two variants, Basic (RO-1 Rocket Launcher) and Precision ([PRO-1 Rocket Launcher](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PRO-1_Rocket_Launcher "PRO-1 Rocket Launcher")). You can recognise the basic rocket launcher in your inventory because it has no special symbol.

## Assembly

You create the RO-1 Rocket Launcher in the [Tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool "Tool") tab of the [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler").
