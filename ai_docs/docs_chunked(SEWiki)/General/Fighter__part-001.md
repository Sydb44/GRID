The iconic Fighter (Beta version)

The Fighter is a [Pre-Built Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Built_Ship "Pre-Built Ship") that is included when creating a new world from the ["Red Ship" and "Green Station" games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content").

## Description

This Fighter was designed to be a short ranged interceptor. It is space-worthy with 31 small [Ion Thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ion_Thruster "Ion Thruster") and two [Large Ion Thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Ion_Thruster "Large Ion Thruster") for acceleration and equally fast braking. A Mass of 22,473 kg makes this ship the galactic standard for Ion thruster fighters.

The design strives to shed mass by not including any batteries. Instead it relies solely on Uranium as fuel: Its power systems consist solely of five  [![Icon Block Small Reactor.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Small_Reactor.png/21px-Icon_Block_Small_Reactor.png?64124d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Reactor "Small Reactor") [Small Reactors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Reactor "Small Reactor") and one  [![Icon Block Large Reactor.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Large_Reactor.png/21px-Icon_Block_Large_Reactor.png?f77bf9)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Reactor "Large Reactor") [Large Reactor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Reactor "Large Reactor")bringing the power output to a steady 17.25 MW. To the shipyard's credit, this fighter's reactors are well conveyored and easy to refuel.

This craft contains no oxygen tank nor O2/H2 generator which forces the pilot to carry oxygen bottles in the inventory. It makes up for this minor weakness in its increased manoeuverability, assisted by its three  [![Icon Block Gyroscope.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Gyroscope.png/21px-Icon_Block_Gyroscope.png?c8eb45)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") [Gyroscopes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope").

The Gatling guns are conveyored to two  [![Icon Block Small Cargo Container.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Small_Cargo_Container.png/21px-Icon_Block_Small_Cargo_Container.png?4af936)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Cargo_Container "Small Cargo Container") [Small Cargo Containers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Cargo_Container "Small Cargo Container") each, for use as ammunition bins. The conveyors are exposed withour armor which puts them at risk to be shot up and breaking in battle. The  [![Icon Block Rocket Launcher.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Rocket_Launcher.png/21px-Icon_Block_Rocket_Launcher.png?b2064b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket_Launcher "Rocket Launcher") [Rocket Launchers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket_Launcher "Rocket Launcher"), however, must be reloaded manually from the front.

The legacy dual  [![Icon Block Small Connector.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Small_Connector.png/21px-Icon_Block_Small_Connector.png?a2278e)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Connector "Small Connector") [Small Connectors/Ejectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Connector "Small Connector") were originally designed to eject shell casings of the Gatling guns. This demonstrates the antiquity of the design, because Gatling shell casings no longer exist as a debris component, making them redundant.

It includes a [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") but strangely lacks a [camera](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Camera "Camera"). It has one  [![Icon Block Connector.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Connector.png/21px-Icon_Block_Connector.png?30a126)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") [Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") on the bottom for docking and for pulling Uranium. On the bottom it also has two  [![Icon Block Landing Gear.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png/21px-Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png?d381be)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear")s which can also be used to tug enemy wrecks.
