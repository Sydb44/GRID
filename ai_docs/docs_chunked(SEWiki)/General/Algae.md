(#searchInput)

Algae is often your first ingredient of the [Food](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food") mechanic. Use it for producing, for example, the Meal Pack (Kelp Crisp).

## How to obtain

To obtain Algae, build an [Algae Farm](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Algae_Farm "Algae Farm"). You can sometimes also find food items as loot.

On planets and in space stations, if you can, build the Algae Farm on the same grid as your Oxygen Farm and Solar Panels. Then use a Custom Turret Controller to align the solar panels to follow the sun. The farms and solar panels will gain the same optimal solar exposure benefits.

## Usage

Algae is a photosynthetic, robust, low-nutrient food source that cannot be eaten raw. Engineers can grow Algae anywhere with water and sunlight, even in space.

If Algae is all you have, queue up Meal Pack (Kelp Crisp) in the [Food Processor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food_Processor "Food Processor") or [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit") to produce food. But as soon as you have [Grains](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grains "Grains") and [Vegetables](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Vegetables "Vegetables"), or even [Insect Meat (Raw)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Insect_Meat_\(Raw\) "Insect Meat (Raw)") at your disposal, cancel the Kelp Crisp recipes, because then it's better to use the Algae in more nutritious recipes.
