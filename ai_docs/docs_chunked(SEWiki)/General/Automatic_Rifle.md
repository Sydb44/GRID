**Obsolete!**  
This article is about something now **obsolete** that is no longer present in [Space Engineers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineers "Space Engineers"). The page stays on the Wiki for historic purposes.

The  [![Icon Item Automatic Rifle.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Automatic_Rifle.png/21px-Icon_Item_Automatic_Rifle.png?10a697)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automatic_Rifle "Automatic Rifle") Automatic Rifle was a tool in Space Engineers. It was replaced by the [MR-20](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/MR-20 "MR-20") series rifle.

The Automatic Rifle was a handheld weapon which fires bullets when used. The rifle used to require [5.56x45mm NATO magazines](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/5.56x45mm_NATO_magazine "5.56x45mm NATO magazine") to fire, and did not need to be reloaded. Clicking the left mouse button fired a short burst, clicking the right mouse button toggled aiming down sights or firing from the hip. Firing while floating freely in space would result in a slight push opposite of the direction of fire.

## Assembly

Alongside the default rifle, there used to be three upgraded versions of the Automatic Rifle. The Precise Rifle was far more accurate and had higher damage, but fired half as fast as the standard rifle. The Rapid-fire Rifle had a higher rate of fire at the expense of lower damage, accuracy, and more ammo consumption. The Elite Rifle was better in nearly every way, but was expensive to produce, requiring platinum and silver. Standard rifles could be produced in a [Basic Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Basic_Assembler "Basic Assembler"). All rifles could be crafted in the advanced [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") with the recipes listed below, on the "Realistic" setting.

| Rifle Upgrades | Iron (Fe) | Nickel (Ni) | Cobalt (Co) | Silver (Ag) | Platinum (Pt) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard | 3.00 | 1.00 | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| Precise | 3.00 | 1.00 | 5.00 | 0   | 0   |
| Rapid-Fire | 3.00 | 8.00 | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| Elite | 3.00 | 1.00 | 0   | 6.00 | 4.00 |
