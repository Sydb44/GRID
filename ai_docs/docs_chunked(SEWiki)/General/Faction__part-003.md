You may want to look up which NPC factions or Player factions exist, what their reputation is, and who the members are.

On the Faction tab, filter the list by:

*   All -- List all factions
*   Show Me -- List your own faction quickly
*   Non Player -- Show only NPCs factions, for example, NPC traders
*   Show Friends -- Show factions who are your allies
*   Show Enemies -- Show factions that have declared war
*   Show Neutrals -- Show factions that have not gained or lost any repuation with you yet
*   Unknown -- Show undiscovered factions, typically, NPC traders
*   Discovered -- Show NPC factions that you have encountered (or all player factions)
*   Players Factions -- Exlude NPCs

## Who is Friend or Foe?

Your [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") displays signals of other players' names and the names of ships' beacons. Prefixed before the name, the signal text includes the faction tag. Signals appear in different colors depending on the faction's relationship to you.

*   **Blue** -- Beacons that you own.
*   **Green** -- Players and beacons in your own faction.
*   **White** -- Neutral players and beacons in friendly allied factions.
*   **Red** -- Enemy players and beacons, or someone who's not in any faction.

## How to Handle Shared Finances?

After joining a faction, you can see the faction's private info including the shared "space bank account". Using the bank account is optional but useful to collect “taxes” to purchase [Zone Chips](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Zone_Chip "Zone Chip"). An **Activity Log** keeps track of which faction members deposited and withdrew money. Beware of thieves of opportunity within your ranks.

1.  Deposit [Space Credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Credits "Space Credits") in your personal player account through a [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") or [ATM](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/ATM "ATM")\].
2.  Press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and go to the **Factions** tab.
3.  Select **Show Me** from the menu and select your faction.  
    You now see its account balance in the bottom row.
4.  Click either **Deposit** or **Withdraw**.  
    A window opens where you see your **Personal Balance** and the **Activity Log**.
5.  Enter an **Amount** to either deposit or withdraw, then click **OK**.

The credits are transferred from your personal account to the faction account.

Important: You cannot directly withdraw money from the faction account while trading at a [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") or [ATM](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/ATM "ATM").

To buy e.g. Zone Chips for the faction, you need cash:

1.  Open the **Faction** tab.
2.  Withdraw money from the faction account into your personal account.
3.  Go to an [ATM](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/ATM "ATM") or [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") and withdraw cash.
4.  Pay cash at the [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store").

## How to Leave the Faction?

Once a faction is created in a world, it will not be dismissed until the last player or last NPC leaves. (Note that "NPCs" in the vanilla game don’t appear as Engineers characters, there are only drones, ships, and stations.)

Press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), go to the **Factions** tab, and find your current faction which is highlighted in blue. To leave your faction, select your current faction, and click **Leave**.

If you leave your faction, or never join one, or are kicked, you are factionless. If a multiplayer server imposes faction-based block limits, factionless players cannot (?) build anything. Arbitrarily leaving factions is discouraged by a reputation penality.
