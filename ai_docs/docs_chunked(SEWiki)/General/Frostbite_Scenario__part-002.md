A friendly Mule drone at the Mining Base can be sent to ferry players quickly between the _Landing Site_ and the _Old Mining Base_, which is helpful if a player has to respawn at the Landing Site.

Repair the mining rover and drive it to the abandoned mine entrance where you grind down the entrance barricade.

### Blocked Tunnel

Use the miner to dig your way through from the _Blocked Tunnel_ marker to the Research Facility. Watch out for interior turrets, defense drones, and gas leaks while you approach the Triton Research Facility Gate.

### Triton Research Facility

Search the **Triton Research Facility** for clues (several voice messages and displays) regarding the whereabouts of the missing containers. Inside the Facility, gather medical components and parts to repair the medical room as safe respawn point. As usual, watch out for interior defenses.

You find the research facility under lockdown, with one data container in the **Manufacturing Line** and three moved to the _Research Archives_. There is a sneaky staircase behind the control station overlooking the manufacturing line on the top floor to access it and open the door. The containers look like large Timer blocks with a Battery. Use a crane that can be steered from Manufacturing Line Controls panel. After retrieving the container from the manufacturing line, you use another button panel to lift the cargo bay lockdown and open the gate, where you can use a forklift to transport the first data container to the elevator.

### Cavern

Take the elevator deeper into the caverns past a reactor. You find **the cavern entrance** under lockdown, and you can either lift the lockdown by initiating a reactor meltdown, or by retrieving and attaching the lockdown module (found at the Weather Station on Mount Frostbite) to the proper merge block.

Once you infiltrate the drone production facility, you can disable and re-enable the reactor cooling, this way all drones programming will be overwritten. If you do so, the final wave of drones that attack after all four containers have been delivered to the landing zone will be smaller.

On the way to **the Archives**, there are tunnels to explore.

### The Archives

After reaching the Archives, you locate the containers in the secure storage and disable the safe zone to retrieve them. You use a forklift to stack them on a semi-trailer and proceed to the surface access lift, eventually leaving through the other entrance to the caverns. You can drive the first data container here as well. Activate another Survival Kit at the exit.

### Tying Up Loose Ends

Note: Drones will constantly harass you while bringing the containers back to the Landing Site, so if you want to explore the remaining facilities (for example, you can also explore an Observatory, a tower, and another station on a hill), it is recommended to leave the truck with the containers protected in the caverns until the very end.

### Finale

After exploring all facilities, you learn that the ROS intended to weaponize the drones that the employees developed, which caused a riot and the lockdown among the employees, who decided to hide the data containers and to trap themselves underground. At the drone production facility, the chief engineer decided to program every drone to attack all lifeforms, in hope of ending the survivors suffering and making sure no one will ever retrieve the dangerous data containers.

In the end, R.O.S. attack vessels attack the landing site to prevent you from leaving with this knowledge. Shoot them down to win the scenario. Wait a bit until it registers and you receive the Steam Achievement.

## ID Card Locations (Spoilers)

Note: all ID cards are in locations that require either a ladder or building stairs to access.

*   ID card 1 (-1294.47:21333.4:-31781.3) - Requires a grinder and stairs or ladder.
*   ID card 2 (-3305.16:20187.47:-30726.8) - Requires ladder
*   ID card 3 (-3336.77:20111.6:-30756.09) - There are some yellow rails placed sideways near the crane to parkour.
*   ID card 4 (-3471.73:19644.73:-30711.65) - Does not require stairs or ladder
*   ID card 5 (-2946.09:18624.29:-31694.51) - Requires a grinder and stairs or ladder.
*   ID card 6 (-2611.91:17360.89:-32305.53) - Does not require stairs or ladder
*   ID card 7 (-3180.67:20362.71:-30694.57) - Does not require stairs or ladder, but drill will make life easier.

## Easter Egg (Spoiler)

In the research archives, you can find a small conference room where the LED panels show references to the three in-game scenarios that are connected to the [Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)"):

*   R.O.S. Division appears in the [The First Jump Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_First_Jump_Scenario "The First Jump Scenario")
*   R.O.S. Sunset Valley Task Force alludes to the [Lost Colony Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lost_Colony_Scenario "Lost Colony Scenario")
*   R.O.S. Triton Task Force refers to the setting of the Frostbite Scenario
