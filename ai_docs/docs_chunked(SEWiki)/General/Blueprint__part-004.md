1.  Open the **[Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options") > Game** screen and disable "Steam Cloud".
2.  Make backups of _"%appdata%\\SpaceEngineers\\Blueprints\\_" because without the Steam Cloud, blueprints are saved locally.
3.  Enable the Steam Cloud feature only if you have more than one PC and want to transfer Saved Games from one PC to the other.

There is also a common UX issue that publishing blueprints on the Steam Workshop fails simply because it failed to upload the thumbnail screenshot, but the error message does not offer a solution. Try the following workaround:

1.  Open the hidden folder _"%appdata%\\SpaceEngineers\\Blueprints\\_" and find the folder containing your blueprint.
2.  Open the file named either thumb.png or thumb.jpg in MS Paint (or any other graphic editor of your liking) and simply resize it smaller.
3.  Resave the file and overwrite the old file so that it is less than 1 MB in size.
4.  Then try publishing again.

### Console troubleshooting

PlayStation Console Storage and Cloud Storage has a save data limit of 1.08Gb. To reduce the size of your saves, disable the backup function by setting the backup value to zero in the Advanced [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").[\[5\]](#cite_note-5) Then upload your saves and blueprints to mod.io!
