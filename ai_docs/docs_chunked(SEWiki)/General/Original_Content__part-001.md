# Original Content - Official Space Engineers Wiki

These legacy sandbox games among the [New Game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_Game "New Game") templates are the scenarios that the game originally shipped with. They still work, but they will not be updated to include new blocks or new planets. Luckily, you're an engineer, you can add the new blocks yourself.Â ;-)

Sandbox scenarios have no predefined objectives, they serve as quick starting points for you. For up-to-date scenarios, see [Sandbox Games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game").

## The First Jump

The First Jump scenario is a legacy tutorial that still works, but will no longer be updated to teach new game mechanics.

This short singleplayer beginner tutorial offers a linear story with action-packed gameplay, while clearly stated objectives casually teach you the basics of gameplay. Learn controls and interactions in stations, space ships, and land vehicles. Fly spacecraft and drive a tank; explore settings on several planets/moons, space stations, and planetary stations.

For a walkthough, see [The First Jump Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_First_Jump_Scenario "The First Jump Scenario").

## Earth Planet

Start on the Earthlike planet with oxygen, resource nodes, a large ground base, two projections, and three small ships. Contains asteroids, [Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates"), and all planets except Pertam and Triton. It's based on [EasyStation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EasyStation "EasyStation").

## Alien Planet

Start on the Alien planet with a large ground base, two projections, and three small ships. You will need to deal with low oxygen, a rugged landscape, high gravity, hard to find resources, and alien wildlife. Contains asteroids, all planets except Pertam and Triton, and [Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates"). It's based on [EasyStation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EasyStation "EasyStation").

## Moon Base

Start on the airless Moon, near the Earthlike planet, in a large ground base with two projections and three small ships. You will need to manage oxygen and deal with no atmosphere and low gravity. Contains asteroids, [Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates"), and all planets except Pertam and Triton. It's based on [EasyStation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EasyStation "EasyStation").

## Mars Planet

Start on the Mars planet with a large ground base, two projections, and three small ships. You will need to manage oxygen and deal with low atmosphere. Contains asteroids, [Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates"), and all planets except Pertam and Triton. It's based on [EasyStation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EasyStation "EasyStation").

## Dead Drop Arena

This is a 4-versus-4 multiplayer PvP battle arena set in space. It comes with eight space ships docked in a station above planet Mars. No other planets nor timed objectives exist. Its main purpose is to facilitate a quick freeform PvP battle for a group of players.

If it isn't listed, enable [Experimental mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode")[\[1\]](#cite_note-1).

## Crashed Red Ship

An interesting intermediate survival challenge. The player wakes up in the wreckage of a ship that has crashed into an asteroid. The ship was [Big Red](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Red "Big Red"), but is missing most of its front half. It lacks the basic utilities and is not capable of flight anymore, but a clever space engineer can build a new ship from salvage and with resources from the asteroid.

Asteroid belt only, no planets, no objectives.

## Red Ship

The player spawns on an open platform in space with all the facilities they'll need to survive, such as Refinery, Assembler, Medical Room, etc. Three small-grid ships ([Fighter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Fighter "Fighter"), [Miner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Miner "Miner"), and [Constructor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Constructor "Constructor")) are docked here.

The [Big Red](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Red "Big Red") ship is hovering alongside the platform. A second large ship, [Big Blue](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Blue "Big Blue"), can be found nearby in space. Asteroid belt only, infrequent meteor strikes, no planets.

If you want to play an updated version of a similar map, choose [Red Ship v2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Ship_v2 "Red Ship v2").

## Green Station

The player spawns on a large, fully constructed space station with several large and small ships. Like on the Red Ship map, the two large-grid ships [Big Red](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Red "Big Red") and [Big Blue](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Blue "Big Blue") are found at or near the station. There are also two small-grid ships docked here, one is a [Combatant mk.1](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Combatant_mk.1 "Combatant mk.1") and the other is a [Constructor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Constructor "Constructor").

Additionally, you find a ready-to-build framework for a large ship floating in space nearby, consisting mostly of incomplete armor blocks.

Asteroid belt only, no planets, no objectives.

If you want to play an updated version of a similar map, choose [Red Ship v2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Ship_v2 "Red Ship v2").

## Lone Survivor

Apparently, all the ships have left without you. This is a good starter map for engineers who want to progress from creative mode to survival mode.

On this map, you find yourself alone on an asteroid mining platform with multiple functioning utilities at hand: Beacon, Control Seat, Refinery, Assembler, Small Reactor, and Medical Room. Survival could be easy if you [manage your power and oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support").

From here, you can start building up your own space station and spaceships. You can resort to mining, salvaging, or piracy. Tip: Use the set of upside down Landing Gears to magnetically hold any ships to be repaired or wrecks to be salvaged in zero gravity.

Asteroid belt only, no planets, no objectives.

If you want to play an updated version of a similar map, choose [Red Ship v2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Ship_v2 "Red Ship v2").
