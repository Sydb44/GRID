The Firework Launcher is a decorative block that was added in Update 1.203.5 to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Space Engineers.

## Usage

It's a stationary flare launcher for signalling or for putting up a spectacle. The fireworks are shot in various upwards angles and can ricochet off walls, floors, and ceilings, which can do minor damage.

On its topside, the large grid variant has 32 launchers, this means it can shoot at most 32 fireworks in a row before having to reload. The small grid variant can shoot 9 times.

## Usage

To use its function as a launcher, you must charge the block with Fireworks or Flares as ammo and power the block.

1.  Produce the ammo in an [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler").
2.  To place the ammo into the launcher's inventory, aim at it from above, and LMB-click or press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
3.  Open the launcher's [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") and toggle **Shoot** to **On**.

The launcher stops when it's out of fireworks/flares, or when you switch **Shoot** to **off**.

If you have different colours of firework boxes in the inventory, activate the weapon tool slot again to switch to the other ammo.

## Construction

You can build the Launcher on stations, large ships, and small ships, where it takes up 1x1x1 blocks of volume. It needs 200 W to function.

## Inventory

The large grid block has an inventory of 32 litres; the small grid block has an inventory of 6 litres. The inventory can hold only flares and fireworks. It does not connect to the conveyor system, so you need to reload it directly.

## Ammunition

Each box contains 9 fireworks of a color type. The fireworks projectiles are not meant to do any real damage but they can ricochet.
