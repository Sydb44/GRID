Consider that a hostile player can easily capture ([using maglocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear")) a faction-shared grid (or wreck!) outside your safe zone. You do not want such lost grids to be automatically allowed into your force field and pose a Trojan Horse-like security risk.

If you offer [Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") for visitors, remember to configure **Trade Mode** and **Auto-Unlock** options on them. Keep them fully inside.

If you want to offer [contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts") in multiplayer, use a Safe Zone to help protect your trade post from hostile players.

*   Allow allied and neutral players to enter to reach the Store or Contracts blocks.
*   Don't allow non-faction members to use weapons and tools inside.
*   Don't allow grinding and welding to outsiders because that opens your safe zone up to being [hacked](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking").
*   If the target of a repair contract is inside the safe zone, you must allow visitors to use a welder and build projections. (Not safe on PvP Servers.)

On multiplayers servers, players sometimes take temporary shelter in the weapon-free safe zones around [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts").

## Trivia

You can use a safe zone force field as a visual [building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") guide[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) in Survival Mode, for example, to measure a radius or to build something spherical or rectangular of a specific size.

You can use Safe Zones as airbag cushion. If you are about to crash near an NPC outpost in survival and can still aim your fall, try to crash inside the force field. Collision damage is turned off inside NPC safe zones! You then still have to get your ship outside the force field to be able to make repairs because using tools is not allowed inside either. But avoiding crash damage gives you a second chance to survive and recover your ship.

## Construction

This large-grid only block is expensive to build and maintain.

There ares some prerequisites:

*   Because you need to trade with the NPCs for [Zone Chips](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Zone_Chip "Zone Chip"), a requirement for building Safe Zones is that **Economy** must be enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").
*   You can build Safe Zones only on stationary large-grid bases, planets, or asteroids. You cannot switch them on on mobile grids such as ships or rovers.

The block is quite large at 3x2x2 blocks (Width x Depth x Height), so optimally, place it in the center of your base to make use of the full range. A Safe Zone block has only one access terminal with a [customisable LCD surface](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Surface_Options "LCD Surface Options") in the front, but you can also hide the block and control the Safe Zone through the grid's [terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal").

Be prepared to have to access the block's inventory regularly to recharge it with Zone Chips. Safe Zone blocks offer two [conveyor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") ports through which they can pull Zone Chips from attached [inventories](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"): One conveyor port is on the back, opposite of the terminal, and the second conveyor port is underneath.

Tip: If you have bought the [Economy Deluxe Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy_Deluxe_Pack "Economy Deluxe Pack") DLC, you can configure a variety of [Safe Zone Skins](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone_Skins "Safe Zone Skins").
