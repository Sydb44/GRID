# Newsletter - Official Space Engineers Wiki

)

The Keen Softwarehouse' email newsletter contains news about SE updates and exclusive content from Keen Softwarehouse developers:

*   SE development news
*   SE teaser trailers
*   [VRAGE3](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/VRage "VRage") development news
*   GoodAI announcements

For example, SE fans who are asking about a "Space Engineers 2.0" may be interested in VRAGE3 engine news. GoodAI news is e.g. about being able to chat and interact with AI NPCs.

The newsletter is quite concise and comes on the 18th of every month.
