The Unknown is a virtual faction. The faction tag is UNKN.

"Unknown" is not the name of one of the actual [NPC Factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions") within the [lore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lore "Lore"), but it's how the ownership of certain derelicts, wrecks, and other inert [encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Encounters "Encounters") is indicated. Unknown encounters are not owned by any of the known NPC factions, in contrast to other encounters which indicate who owns the grid, for example, [SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates").

The difference in [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") is its impact on faction reputation.

*   The virtual UNKN faction remains permanently neutral, allowing players to interact with UNKN encounters without affecting faction reputation, neither negatively nor positively.
*   On the other hand, if you attack, for example, a SPRT owned encounter, your faction reputation with SPRT decreases; and similarly, if you complete a contract with a Trading Outpost, your faction standing with certain NPCs increases. But UNKN cannot own [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts").
