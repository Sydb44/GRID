# Bio Stalk - Official Space Engineers Wiki

A Bio Stalk is a mysterious plantlike alien growth that is very rarely found underground or on the inside of asteroids.

Danger, keep your distance! When mature, it has proven to burst violently when a person approaches within a few metres. Attempts to approach with a science drone have also triggered an explosion.

## Reported Variants

1.  A yellowish variant has been first reported in 2022 after a cave-in below the mines of the [Argyre Basin Outpost](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800793396) by a Uranium miner, but all specimen are presumed destroyed by the ensuing chain explosions and could not be studied.
2.  A green glowing variant was recently reported in the vicinity of a derelict [bio research lab](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Encounter_Factorum_Bio_Research "Encounter Factorum Bio Research") in an asteroid.

Further study is needed!
