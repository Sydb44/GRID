Global Encounters are events that bring players together on a multiplayer server to engage large NPC [encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Encounters "Encounters") cooperatively — or competitively. These PvE encounters offer challenging end-game content to enhance standard survival gameplay. An old one despawns and a new one spawns roughly every 2 hours from 4000km to 15'000km away from player bases.

1.  Edit your game and open the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") and make sure the Global Encounters Cap slider (!) is at least 1.
2.  On your HUD, a Global Encounter is marked by an orange [Unidentified Signal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unidentified_Signals "Unidentified Signals"). The signal can be close or thousands of km away in space, necessitating a [Jump Drive](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive") to reach it. This indicates to players that this is late game content. Be prepared[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) for a fight.
3.  When you have breached the location, [hack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking#Can_I_hack_Prototech_Blocks? "Hacking") functional blocks to gain ownership. Then access the terminal to [claim](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Claim_NPC_Ship "Claim NPC Ship") the captured base or ship and raid it.

There is no disadvantage in ignoring them (other than not getting the loot). The encounters repeat and you can take them on any time you are ready.
