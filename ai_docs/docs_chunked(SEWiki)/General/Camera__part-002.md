## Trivia

Many ask how to display what the camera sees on an LCD panel. This is not possible in vanilla Space Engineers. Currently the only way to do this would be a custom [Plugin](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Plugins "Plugins").

## Construction

You can build the camera on large and small grids. It takes up a 1x1x1 block (but its hitbox is much smaller). It has only one mount point on its backside.

Pay attention to the camera block's rotation when you build it, your later view rotation depends on it: When placing the camera block, make sure that the "CAMERA" text is readable along the _upper_ edge, and the little light is in the _bottom left_.

Cameras are not stand-alone blocks, that means, if you grind off the block they are mounted on, they are ground off as well.
