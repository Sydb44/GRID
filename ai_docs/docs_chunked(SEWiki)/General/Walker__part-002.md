    1.  Determine the upper and lower limits that achieve the best _forward_ motion.
    2.  Make sure the legs don't bump into each other.
    3.  Position the pairs of legs in _mirrored_ positions for stability.
    4.  Set up a block group that you control by triggering the Reverse actions of the joints.
    5.  Adjust the joint rotation speeds where necessary.
4.  Set up knee hinges/pistons:
    1.  Determine the upper and lower limits that achieve the best _lifting_ motion.
    2.  _Synchronize_ the extends of the legs for stability.
    3.  Set up a second block group that you control by triggering the Reverse action of these joints.
    4.  Adjust the extension speeds, if necessary.
5.  Next, test both groups together and coordinate.
6.  Set up Timers to trigger both groups in a coordinated way.
7.  Enable the Override of one extra gyroscope and leave its RPM values set to zero. This provides stability.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

In science fiction, mechas are imagined as having animal- or human-level senses and skills, such as balance, detecting enemies and obstacles, scaling obstacles, climbing, running, jumping, navigating uneven ground, all while keeping the body stabilized and pilot safe. Walkers are typically given big effin guns or other tools with the goal to extend the pilot's reach. For the pilot's safety, Walkers are supposed to offer the strength and agility of an exoskeleton or power armour, paired with the protection and mobility of a tank.

In reality in general, and in Space Engineers in particular, these goals cannot yet be met: Walkers still have difficulty walking autonomously on anything but solid, even, premapped ground. Their joints are risky weak spots and one well-aimed hit disables their locomotion completely. They are slower than rovers or flying craft and their wobbling steps are detrimental to aiming, so they would be at quite a disadvantage in a mixed PvP battle. Their senses in game are limited to what is supported by [Sensors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor") and [Event Controllers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Event_Controller "Event Controller").
