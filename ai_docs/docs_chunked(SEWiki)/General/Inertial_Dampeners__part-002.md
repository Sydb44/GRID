### When to Switch on Inertial Dampeners?

Inertial Dampeners make handling of your ships or jetpack more intuitive, as the activation of _just the right_ retrograde thrusters will be automatic.

Generally, keep Inertial Dampeners turned on while manoeuvring near obstacles or close to the ground:

*   Landing
*   Docking
*   Travelling down tight mining tunnels
*   Weaving through asteroids

At the same time, the use of Inertial Dampeners makes braking only somewhat easier, as it still depends on the strength of your counter thrusters versus the current speed. While small fighters have little problem stopping, larger ships often "skid" for kilometres if their front thrusters are too weak, and for them, even using Inertial Dampeners still necessitates a rapid retrograde burn[\[1\]](#cite_note-1).

### When to switch off Inertial Dampeners?

For experienced players who want a "realistic" space feel, turning off Inertial Dampeners provides an interesting challenge. In other games this gameplay is called "Flight Assist Off".

There is a great variety of situations that don't require Inertial Dampeners:

*   Fuel-saving Coasting Manoeuvre for long range flights:  
    After you've reached maximum velocity, Inertial Dampeners force you to thrust forward to maintain that speed - which is a pure waste of fuel. A far more efficient procedure is to thrust up to a comfortable velocity, switch Inertial Dampeners off, _coast_ into range of the target, and only at that point reactivate Inertial Dampeners for the braking burn. This works for both jetpack and ships.
*   Minimising thruster damage on takeoff:  
    With Inertial Dampeners off, only a brief engine burn is required to gently get out of thruster damage range of the pad - instead of burning continuously, which leaves gaping holes in [Light Armor Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Light_Armor_Block "Light Armor Block").
*   Carrier operations:  
    A docked ship with Inertial Dampeners on keeps countering the mothership's movement--which can easily result in loss of control and damage. Always switch your Inertial Dampeners (or better, all thrusters) off after docking to a carrier!
*   Relocating valuable wrecks:  
    Flying a heavily damaged ship back to base, with Inertial Dampeners off and manually controlling the only remaining thruster and gyroscope, and landing it without scratching the landing pad's paint. (Bonus bragging rights if said thruster is on the top, but the pilot still manages to touch down softly with the correct orientation.)
*   Escorting:  
    Station-keeping and matching relative speed near other moving vessels.

Use in space battle:

*   Retaining velocity in a fight:  
    A ship with Inertial Dampeners switched on constantly loses velocity, which is a bad thing if one is under fire.
*   Target-leading mind-screw:  
    Since most players instinctively consider the target to be moving in the direction of its bow (Archimedean motion), a ship with Inertial Dampeners off can exploit Newtonian physics and drift while rotated in any position. This manoeuvre confuses many human opponents and is genuinely unpredictable.
*   Engage targets with fixed weapons in any direction without changing velocity:  
    A ship with Inertial Dampeners off can suddenly [spin](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") about and shred any hostile, especially one following it.

## Known Issues

Even with Inertial Dampeners on, atmospheric ships with [subgrids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") (that means, they are using [mechanical blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") such as rotors, hinges, and pistons) sink[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) in gravity. This issue occurs because the game engine has issues calculating Inertial Dampeners accurately, and this inaccuracy results in the vehicle slowly sinking towards the ground. It is often claimed that the game engine does not account for the extra mass, this is inaccurate. If it didn't, the grid would not only sink, it would _fall_. There was a time when this was true, and the behavior was much more pronounced than it is today.
