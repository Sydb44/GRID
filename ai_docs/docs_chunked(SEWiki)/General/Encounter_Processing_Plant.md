## Loot

There is not a lot of loot, some ores and components and a hydrogen tank. You could turn it into a starter base or use its refinery for a mining outpost.

## Spoilers

It can be defeated by taking out two exterior turrets and one interior turret. There are Willis Ducts inside that an intruder can use to sneak around.
