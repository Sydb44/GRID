 [![Icon Block Grinder Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/73/Icon_Block_Grinder_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Grinder_Block.png?88a55d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_Block "Grinder Block") Grinder Block is a massive, ship-mounted version of the [handheld Grinder](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_\(Item\) "Grinder (Item)") used to dismantle blocks and salvage components from wrecks. Grinders are helpful ship tools in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") where Grinder and [Welder Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_Block "Welder Block") are often used together on salvage ships or on [RC](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") repair drones. Stationary grinders are referred to as Grinder Pits. Grinders are redundant in [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode").

## Usage

The Grinder Block is used to speedily and efficiently salvage ships and bases in survival scenarios, which would take much longer to do by hand. While the speed is the same as a handheld grinder, the Grinder Block can grind multiple blocks at once because it has a larger area of effect.

Grinders are essential when building salvage ships, remote controlled repair drones, grinder pits, or [articulated](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") salvage [salvage cranes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Custom_Turret_Controller "Custom Turret Controller").

### What can it grind

[![Ion constructor ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/d/d5/Ion_Constructor_1.jpg/320px-Ion_Constructor_1.jpg?9840cc)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Ion_Constructor_1.jpg)

A player-controlled repair ship with both Welder and Grinder.

Consider the following before use:

*   A Grinder Block does not have any effect on voxels or ores. Use a drill instead.
*   A Grinder Block does not disassemble nor pick up free-floating [items](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item"). Use a [Collector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector") for that.
    *   Exception: If you grind a container full of items, the grinder first picks up the contents from inside, and then the components of the container.
*   Grinder Blocks will not grind their own grid (e.g. the grinder pit). However, Grinder Blocks attached by a piston or rotor are not considered the same grid and the subgrid may be affected.
*   Players in the area of affect get hurt.

### How to use a ship welder

You activate a Grinder Block from the cockpit through the grid's [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"). If you need to switch it on and off often (e.g. in a repair ship), assign its **Block Tool** functions to action keys on the cockpit [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar").

For immersion in a station, you can assign a Grinder Pit de/activation action to a [Button Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Button_Panel "Button Panel").

To comply with Operational Health and Safety laws, install a [Sensor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor") and configure it to activate only when _grids_ are in the area of effect, or to deactivate when players are near!

### How to build a grinder pit

A Grinder Pit is a room full of Grinder Blocks whose areas of effect overlap, typically with a large opening on top. You throw wrecks and [cargo drops](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unknown_Signals "Unknown Signals") in the pit to have them dismantled automatically.

Instead of dropping the wrecks, you can also hold them in place using landing gear on pistons, and push the wreck into the Grinder Pit in a more controlled fashion, similar in structure to a [3D Printer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer"), but opposite in function.

When dismantling mobile grids, be prepared for loose blocks being ejected from the grinder pit, or parts drifting off in low gravity and crashing into your ship. Wrecks of mobile grids no longer stabilise themselves and are affected by physical forces that can damage other grids.

Wreck pieces ejecting and damaging your salvage ship are no issue when grinding down static (!) stations using a grinder ship. One of the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") determines whether unsupported parts of stations will drift away or remain static.

## Damage

When active, the area of effect of the grinder blades is lethal to players in Survival Mode.

Similar to  [![Icon Block Landing Gear.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/2/2d/Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png/21px-Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png?d381be)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") and [Wheels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel "Wheel"), the Grinder itself is resistant to damage from collisions. Assuming one approaches the wreck at reasonable speeds, there should be little danger of harming the Grinder during normal use.
