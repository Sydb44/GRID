The **Large Steel Tube** is commonly used in the construction of functional [blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block"). Despite requiring only a common ore such as iron, it cannot be built right away in early game in a Survival Kit, since it requires at least a Basic Refinery. It is one of the bulkier components and it can only pass through large [conveyor ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system").
