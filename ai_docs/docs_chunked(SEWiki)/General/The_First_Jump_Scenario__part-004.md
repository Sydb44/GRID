| Story | Learn how to... |
| Setting: Mars  <br>You come to inside your crashed frigate. Reactor meltdown is imminent and you exit the frigate quickly before it explodes. You look up and in the sky, you see the Earthlike planet and its moon far away. You are in the Mars desert. |     |
| Your allies send you coordinates to a Landing Zone nearby, where a yellow Rebel Atmo Frigate passes and drops supplies: A cargo container with a weapon and ammo, and a tank-like vehicle with gatlings and rocket launchers. | Enter the land vehicle [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). |
| Cutscene: Ahead lies the battle ground, past crashed yellow and red ships, there is the red base, ROS-4, hidden in the side of a Mars mountain. |     |
| You drive forwards and shoot down all attacking red fleet’s rovers and ships, and also the defenses on the base. Don't shoot down the yellow fleet's ship. Drive up to the gate and use the rocket launcher to breach it. | Unlock the handbrake ([P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Drive with WASD keys. You can press [V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to change your point of view. Press numbered toolbar slots to enter turret control, [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click to shoot, press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to exit turret control.  <br>Tip: Hold [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") to use [Target Locking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Target_Locking "Target Locking")! |
| If your tank is destroyed, you choose the next-best option: Go to one of the marked "usable ship wreckages", follow the green arrows to sit in a control seat inside, and control the wreck's rocket launchers/turrets to destroy the gate. | Turret control tutorial, continued. |
| When it's save to approach the base (there is no prompt), enter through the breached gate and go deeper into the base. Roadblocks stop your tank, so you proceed on foot through a long hangar with offline drones and locked cargo containers. The drone factory lies just ahead.  <br>The AI detects strange signals and assumes the artefact is close--as is the CEO of the R.O.S. corporation, who is "not happy" with you. You use the marked Door Control button to open the door to the factory. |     |

| Story | Learn how to... |
| Cutscene: You are inside the factory where the [R.O.S.](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") corporation produces all its small ships and drones. |     |
| You notice two ships in bay 01 and 02 have cockpits and are unsecured. The AI emphasises that shooting the extending control blocks in the center will interfere with the hostile drones' programming. You notice three production tubes that will release newly made hostile drones to attack you. The AI conceeds "It's an impressive factory, for a human design at least, except maybe for that giant fan." The AI warns you to not fall into the ventilation shaft in the center of the factory. |     |
| The CEO Marcus readies a red ship: "I'll be with you soon, Engineer. In the meantime, please enjoy the company of my drone army."  <br>Enter one of the ships for the boss fight. Stay alive and defeat hostile (red) drones. When you see a control block exposed in the core, destroy it. This allows friendly (green) drones to hack and weaken the facility. You'll see the drone production tubes status change from „normal“ to „hacked“ if you were successful. | Unlock the ship‘s landing gear ([P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")), steer with WASD keys and mouse, shoot with [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left"). |
| Cutscene: "Warning: Large ship detected, recommend evasive manoeuvres!" Marcus appears in his red ship and makes threats against you and/or the [Sol Cooperative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative"). |     |
| This is the boss fight. After you destroy the large red ship, the AI congratulates you, even though it was already halfway done writing a mission failure report. A secret tunnel above you becomes accessible. | Shoot down the opponent. Fly up to the "Artefact" marker using your jetpack ([X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")) or in your fighter ship. |
| Approach the stolen [artefact](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Monolith "Monolith") and discover its purpose.  <br>"Eng--in--eer...... Come... there is....much for you to see." You are surrounded by Jump Drive-like sparks and are teleported away... |     |
