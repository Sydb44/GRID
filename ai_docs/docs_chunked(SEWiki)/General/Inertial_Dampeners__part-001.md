# Inertial Dampeners - Official Space Engineers Wiki

In science fiction, inertial dampeners or inertia dampers are a helpful movement-related game mechanic for both the player's [jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") as well as a ship's [thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster_mechanics "Thruster mechanics"). Enabling Inertial Dampeners lets you learn the game first and worry about realism later. Press the [Z key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle Inertial Dampeners on and off.

Did you know? In other sci-fi games, Inertial Dampeners are known as "Flight Assist" or "Coupled/Decoupled Mode".

## Why Inertial Dampeners?

Realistic zero-gravity flight mechanics have some unintuitive aspects that would present a hurdle for everyone but experienced astronauts, hence games simplify them.

### Problem

When travelling in the vacuum of zero-gravity space, there is no air or ground friction, and nothing naturally slows down a ship's or player's inertia. After the smallest acceleration, ships or players continue drifting at that speed in that direction until they hit an obstacle. A realistic implementation of space flight feels frustrating to new players, like aquaplaning or sliding on ice without control. You need to learn how to react.

### Solution

To be able to turn, slow down, or brake in space, we must cancel our inertia by exerting _a force in the exact opposite direction_. This is unintuitive for human beings who are used to friction slowing us down as soon as we "take the foot off the gas pedal". It's especially unintuitive because empty space offers no landmarks for us to determine our speed or direction of movement in the first place.

In Science Fiction, Inertial Dampeners simulate the familiar braking friction from planet Earth. Enable Inertial Dampeners and you slow down and come to a halt. If there is no active player input in a direction (= "foot off the gas pedal"), the thrusters in the opposite direction turn on automatically and cancel out the velocity. This intuitive damping is similar how friction would slow down an unpowered car rolling on a flat street.

## Usage

Press the [Z key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle Inertial Dampeners on and off.

Inertial Dampeners are built into both your personal [jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") and can be activated in ship thrusters. Inertial Dampeners are not available for wheeled vehicles.

In order to make the Inertial Dampeners fully functional, build the ship to have at least one [thruster](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster "Thruster") facing in each cardinal direction: forwards, backwards, left, right, up, and down. Gyroscopes cannot alter a spacecraft's speed and are not used here. The player's jetpack always has thrust in all six directions.

To toggle the Inertial Dampeners in a ship, the engineer must be seated in a [cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit").

*   In a ship, the toggle stays on even after engineers exit the cockpit.
*   If engineers have turned off the ship's Inertial Dampeners while seated in a cockpit, and exit the seat, the jetpack's Inertial Dampeners will be turned off as well. Meaning, players will drift with the same velocity as the ship they exited. This is helpful to avoid complications with runaway ships.

**Example:** Your atmo ship is falling downwards and forwards. Your braking thrusters are broken, but your lifting thrusters still work. You switch on Inertial Dampeners: The dampeners activate the lifting thusters to cancel out only the downward movement, you stop falling. But they fail to activate your broken braking thrusters, so you'd keep drifting forward.

### How to Match Speed (Relative Dampers)?

A ship pilot or a jetpacking engineer can match speed by engaging Relative Dampers.

1.  Look at another moving ship (or player)
2.  Press [CTRL+Z key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

In the [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"), speed matching is called **Auto**.

This setting let you follow a moving grid or player by automatically matching speed with the target. Relative Dampers are also helpful for catching a corpse's backpack that's drifting in space.

Keen added this feature in version [1.188](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Version_History "Version History").

### How to overcome a lack of thruster directions?

It can happen due to a collision or battle damage: The damage or destruction of some directional thrusters eliminates the convenience of automatic Inertial Dampeners, you drift. But you are not "dead in the water": With practice and skill, it is possible to cancel inertia and come to a stop even with incomplete thruster coverage:

Use [Gyroscopes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") to tilt and turn the remaining thrusters manually to face the drift direction until you cancel the inertia. If you are in gravity, you must additionally use half of your available thrust to keep flying, so angle the ship at roughly 45 degrees towards the gravity well.

**Tip:** This manoeuvre is used by experienced players to fly a single-thruster [starter drop-pod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pod "Drop Pod").

### When to Switch on Inertial Dampeners?

Inertial Dampeners make handling of your ships or jetpack more intuitive, as the activation of _just the right_ retrograde thrusters will be automatic.

Generally, keep Inertial Dampeners turned on while manoeuvring near obstacles or close to the ground:

*   Landing
*   Docking
*   Travelling down tight mining tunnels
*   Weaving through asteroids

At the same time, the use of Inertial Dampeners makes braking only somewhat easier, as it still depends on the strength of your counter thrusters versus the current speed. While small fighters have little problem stopping, larger ships often "skid" for kilometres if their front thrusters are too weak, and for them, even using Inertial Dampeners still necessitates a rapid retrograde burn[\[1\]](#cite_note-1).
