*   Maybe putting the 'no ores spawn nearby' in the giant yellow box was overkill, yesterday I spent literally hours trying to figure out why my ore detector wasn't working, turns out there just weren't any ores nearby. Would have built my base in a different place if I knew better. If someone wants to kill the giant banner go for it, but please keep the 'no ores spawn near outposts' note somewhere on the page, since AFAIK it isn't on the wiki anywhere except for where I added it here --Lightningtow123 ([talk](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/User_talk:Lightningtow123 "User talk:Lightningtow123")) [22:03, 12 November 2024 (UTC)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Talk:Trading_Outposts#c-Lightningtow123-20241112220300)Reply
    *   Thanks! I added a link to a forum post with more details and tried to find a context for this information. I could only find a source saying that there are no ores with 8km, where did you get "a few hundreds km" from? --[AdaRynin](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/User:AdaRynin "User:AdaRynin") (talk) [09:58, 14 November 2024 (UTC)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Talk:Trading_Outposts#c-AdaRynin-20241114095800-Lightningtow123-20241112220300)Reply
