The Encounter Vanguard Outpost is one of the [Planetary Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planetary_Encounters "Planetary Encounters") that appears as a possibly neutral signal on your [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"). It is owned by a random faction.

## Description

Approach this signal with extreme caution if you don't want an artilery shell surprise. This base has three floors, an outside staircase, and is surounded by smaller towers. It could make a good structure to occupy if you need a starter base, or you can salvage it for parts.

After you get around of the turrets, catwalk stairs lead up to a door. The top floor is a round walkway with a view all around.

A ladder goes down to the middle floor: a storage room with an O2/H2 generator, batteries, cargo, and [AI Defensive](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/AI_Defensive "AI Defensive") block. A bed may contain a datapad with [lore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lore "Lore") about the world and the attitude of people in it.

In the lowest floor are some circular [Willis Ducts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Willis_Ducts "Willis Ducts").

## Loot

The cargo containers and barrels are filled with a mix of valuable components and ores. A weapon rack is filled with rifles and ammo.
