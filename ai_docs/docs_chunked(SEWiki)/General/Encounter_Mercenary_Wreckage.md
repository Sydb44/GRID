The wreckage of the Mercenary

The Mercenary Wreckage is a derelict ship which can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is enabled in your world. You might find it by following the "[SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") for 1s every minute, from a distance of ~25 km. It is most commonly found close to an asteroid or even buried in one.

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

  
Engineers should aproach with great caution, as there are a few still active interior and gatling turrets mounted on the ships hull.

Occasionally, multiple salvage drones will also spawn next to the wreck. Multiple engineer corpses can also be found on the ship.

A possible backstory of the wreck is that the Mercenary got attacked by space pirates on its way to colonize a far away planet, and the wreck was left to drift for decades, before becoming buried in an asteroid.

## The Original Ship

Original creator of this ship is Aragath, KSH staff. [Here is the very first screenshot of the Encounter](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1239984959). A restored version of the wreck can be found on steam by lolmelon3. Screenshots of the Encounter early prototype can be found on Aragath's Steam Workshop: [Screenshot 1](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=647265375), [Screenshot 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=647262206) and [Screenshot 3](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=647262193).

## Properties

*   Mass: 1,600,000 kg
*   Blocks: 1,497

## Contents

The ship does not contain any notable cargo, only components from salvaging the wreck. It is possible to restore the ship, however it is a real challenge in survival mode. The ship contains multiple decorative DLC blocks, which will be visible, but cannot be used and will not provide components if destroyed, if the player does not have the DLC installed.

An Engineers corpse in the bridge of the wreck

There are three dead corpses within the Encounter: one on the bridge and two in the crew quarters. Their presence may be a problem for recreating airtightness. Sometimes it's impossible to grind them off, and then you have to cover them from the outside with armor blocks.
