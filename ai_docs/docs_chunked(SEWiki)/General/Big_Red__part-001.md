**Big Red** is a [Pre-Built](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Built_Ship "Pre-Built Ship") [Large Grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") ship that is present along with the [Big Blue](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Blue "Big Blue") in several of the [easy-start type games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content"). In the game lore, the red fleet is possibly owned by the [Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") faction. A vessel of the Big Red class is also present in the [Crashed Red Ship game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content"), where the player starts near a unit which has collided with an asteroid. As a result of the collision, the ship's front has been destroyed/mangled beyond recognition, but its propulsion systems are still operational.

The ship has two cockpits. One is located near the rear, while the other is in a glass canopy at the very front. The latter can be flown in first-person view.

### Role

Although there is no official large ship classification system in the game, the Big Red appears to have been designed as a light carrier, as it is equipped with a large hangar accessible from the front and the sides, and a hangar deck reinforced with heavy armor blocks (which is highly resistant to small ship thrusters). In any case, the large hangar with its multiple entrances makes this ship suitable for use as a mothership for [small ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid").

## History

This was the ship most often used by developers to test sim speed when testing new code. Because Xocliw uses the ship the most to test the game, it is the unofficial flag ship of the Space Engineers IP. It is also the most frequently altered and upgraded ship in Space Engineers, undergoing many many many reiterations, such as [Red (Corvette)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_\(Corvette\) "Red (Corvette)"). The newest version is [Red Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_Ship "Red Ship").
