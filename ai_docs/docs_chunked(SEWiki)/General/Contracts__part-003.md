This shortcut is useful to review your accepted contracts while you are not in the vicinity of any Contracts blocks. It answers the common question, "Wait, was it 100 iron _ore_ or _ingots_ I was supposed to bring?" Check the Contracts screen on the go if you don't remember what conditions you need to fulfil, or which components or how many materials you were supposed to gather, etc.

## What does collateral mean? What is in "the Package"? (Hauling)

After accepting Hauling contracts, a  [![Icon Item Package.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Package.png/21px-Icon_Item_Package.png?7bda1c)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package") [Package](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package") item will appear in your [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"). The NPC clients require you to deposit a collateral, an amount of space credits of equal value to the package, as theft prevention.

Outside of the contract, the package item is worthless to players.

*   Failure or theft: If you steal or lose the client’s package instead of delivering it, you do not get your collateral money back. This means, as a penalty, you paid damages for the (for you, worthless) package.
*   Successful delivery: If you fulfil the contract, you automatically get the full collateral back, plus the service payment the client offered!

NPC-generated contracts ask for collateral only in Hauling contracts. Technically, asking for a collateral is optional in all player-created contracts. It makes no sense though to demand a Collateral for other types of contracts where the client cannot lose anything. For example, if you ask the contractor to deliver gold to you, and the contractor abbandons the contract, then you simply don't pay them. You don’t lose anything, so you don’t need to ask for collateral.

## How Do I offer my own contracts?

Building your own [Contracts Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts_Block "Contracts Block") and creating your own contracts makes sense only on Multiplayer servers. It's also your own responsibility to [protect](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone") your trading outposts so that players can trade, but cannot dismantle your base.

Here is how to set the required blocks up on your Trade Outposts:

1.  Build your own Contracts blocks in Outposts that you have built, that you own, and that have power.
2.  Go to the [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen") and name your outposts so you can recognise them later.
3.  Go to the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") and name the Contracts blocks so you can recognise them later.
4.  (For Hauling/Acquisition only:) Set up ([Laser](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Laser_Antenna "Laser Antenna")) [Antennas](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna") on the start and delivery outposts. The start and delivery Contracts blocks must be able to "see" one another. (Verify)
5.  Face the Contract block and press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to interact with it. Go to the **Administration** tab and define your contracts, as described next.

Administration Screen of a Contracts Blocks

For all Contracts:

1.  Enter a **Payment** how much you are willing to pay for the job in space credits.
2.  Enter a **Collateral** in space credits. For most contracts except Hauling, you will leave this at zero.
3.  Enter a **Duration** in minutes. Enter zero to make the Duration unlimited.
4.  Select the type: Acquisition, Repair, Search, or Hauling.
5.  Define Contract-specific details (see below).
6.  Then click **Create** and the contract is published on the **Available Contracts** screen of this Contracts block.

On this screen, you can also **Delete** your contract offer if you don't want it any more.

Note that you cannot provide a description for your contract. If you want to tell a story, use [LCD Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Panels "LCD Panels") or [Data Pads](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Data_Pads "Data Pads")!

### Acquisition

Choose this type if you are looking to buy goods off other players.

1.  Select the **Target Block** where the contractor shall deliver the goods; it can be the same Contracts block or one in another trading outpost that you own and that is reachable by [antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna").
2.  Specify the **item type** and **item amount** of goods that you wish to buy. It can be any in-game item — [materials](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material"), [components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component"), or [consumables](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Consumable "Consumable").
3.  Enter a **payment** in [space credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits").
4.  Leave the Collateral at zero.

### Repair

Pay other players on a multiplayer server to bring components and help build or repair an incomplete grid of yours.

1.  Select as a **Target grid** an incomplete or damaged station/ship/rover of yours.
2.  Leave the Collateral at zero.
3.  Enter a **payment** in [space credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits").
4.  [Project](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") the grid’s [blueprint](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") onto itself so your contractors know what you need repaired!
5.  Remember to allow other players to weld projections inside your [Safe Zone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone")!

### Search

Have you lost track of a drone that is still powered and listed on your [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen")? Or do you simply want to show off your creative building skills and provide exploration content on a multiplayer server?

Leave a powered Grid anywhere and pay other players to “find” it. You gain nothing but a nice roleplay/PvP opportunity.

1.  Select one **Target grid** of yours.
2.  Provide a **search radius** between 0 and 99999 metres. The optimal distance depends on the size of the target. For example, for small-grid targets like cargo drops, choose less than 1000m.
3.  Leave the Collateral at zero.
4.  Enter a **payment** in [space credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits").

Consider whether you need a Safe Zone around the target grid, otherwise players may grind it down.
