The Sound Block is a block that can play included sound files, for example, play an alarm when a sensor detects an enemy.

## Usage

Use this block to play alerts, informational messages, or simply music. Each sound block can be set to play one song, there is no playlist.

A sound block is different from the [Jukebox](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jukebox "Jukebox") from the [Decorative Pack 2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack_2 "Decorative Pack 2") DLC in so far as the Sound Block does not have an in-world user interface for engineers to select songs. Without the DLC, you could build a Jukebox out of (for example) [Button Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Button_Panel "Button Panel") that trigger several Sound Blocks that have the individual songs configured.

### How play a sound

1.  Choose a **Volume** between 0-100%.
2.  Choose a **Range** between 0-500 metres how far away the sound should be audible.
3.  Now select either a sound or a loop from the list.
4.  Set a **Loop Time** between 1-59 secs or 1-30 mins. This slider is only available if you have selected a loop.

### Available sounds or loops

Spoken alerts:

*   "Lights on!"
*   "Lights off!"
*   "Warning! Enemy detected!"
*   "Objective complete."

Loops:

*   Alert 1 - a klaxon
*   Alert 2 - beepbeepbeepbeep (could also be a reversing truck)
*   Alert 3 - a speaking voice ("Military Alert"?)
*   Drone Small/Medium/Large/Huge - an industrial droning noise

Music:

*   Original sound track
*   [Sounds of Space Engineers Competition](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sounds_of_Space_Engineers_\(2021_Competition\) "Sounds of Space Engineers (2021 Competition)").

## Trivia

There a only few sounds included, but if you're on Steam, you can saerch for sound mods to amend the list: [Sound Block Sounds by --Kaos--](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1596101726) or [Klaxons and Other Sounds for Sound Block](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=356980097)

## Construction

The block requires power to work. It exists for large and small grid and takes up a 1x1x1 blocks space.
