# Workshop - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![Steam-Workshop-logo.jpg](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Steam-Workshop-logo.jpg/320px-Steam-Workshop-logo.jpg?44a456)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Steam-Workshop-logo.jpg)

The workshop is a place where SE players can share a vast variety of blueprints, assets, custom worlds, scenarios, scripts, and mods to be used in game.

There are two workshops:

*   [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/244850/workshop/) exclusively for players on Steam (PC).
*   [Mod.io](https://spaceengineers.mod.io/) can be used by all platforms (including Steam players). This was added later when the game became available to more platforms than the initial Steam release.

> Did you know? The Space Engineers Workshop is the 4th largest on Steam with over 500K mods, ships, stations, worlds, and more!

## What's the difference?

Players can upload all types of community content to both Mod.io and Steam Workshop, but not all platforms support everything.

*   The PC platform (Steam and Windows Store) can run anything from the workshop platform they have access to, and also things outside of it like [Plugins](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Plugins "Plugins").
*   Console (Xbox & Playstation) manufacturers do not allow user code to run on their consoles, this impacts the usability of [mods with scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods") and [ingame scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripts "Scripts") (cannot run them at all if the console hosts the world).

[Dedicated servers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Setting_up_a_Space_Engineers_Dedicated_Server "Setting up a Space Engineers Dedicated Server") that have crossplay enabled can add serverside-only mod scripts and can allow ingame scripts (which always run serverside), this also means that console players can use the  [![Icon Block Programmable Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Programmable_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Programmable_Block.png?9d067f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block") [Programmable Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block") (ingame scripts) on these servers.

Before installing anything, it's a good idea to **read the description** for any special requirements it might have, regardless of the modding or hardware platform you're using.

## What can I find on the workshops?

Examples of things that can be shared through Workshops:

*   [Mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods"), two types:
    *   SBC Mods: Adds or modifies content in line with what the game can do, generally new blocks, items, recipes, sounds, suits, planets, etc.
    *   Script Mods: Completely new functionality, new LCD apps, etc.
*   [Blueprints](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint"): A means of sharing your ships, rovers, stations, mechs, etc. If blueprints contain DLC/modded blocks, you can only build the blueprint if you have the DLC/mod as well.
*   [Ingame Scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripts "Scripts"): The  [![Icon Block Programmable Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Programmable_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Programmable_Block.png?9d067f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block") [Programmable Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block") uses scripts to control blocks, detect the status of the environment, and display information dynamically.
*   Worlds: [Sandbox Games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game") and [Scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") (such as [Escape from Mars](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1653185489)).

## How to Publish

Depending on the type:

*   Worlds: From the main menu -> Load Game screen, select the world then on the left side there's Publish.
*   [Blueprints](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint"): From inside a world, press F10 (default) to open the blueprint browser, there you can select a local blueprint (house icon) and click Publish.
*   [Ingame scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripts "Scripts"): From inside a world, open any  [![Icon Block Programmable Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Programmable_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Programmable_Block.png?9d067f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block") [Programmable Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block")'s [control panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal#Control_Panel "Terminal"), click Edit -> Browse Scripts then select a local script (house icon) and click Publish.
*   [Mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding "Modding"): From the main menu -> Load Game -> (select any world) -> Edit Settings -> Mods, then select the local mod (house icon) on either side and click Publish.
    *   For more details: [Creating And Uploading Mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding/Tutorials/Creating_And_Uploading_Mods "Modding/Tutorials/Creating And Uploading Mods")

### How to update a published item

Simply publish the same entry again and it should override the previously published item. There are bugs around this so always check if it published a new item instead.

To first update a local blueprint, you can copy the ship in [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") or [Creative Tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Tools "Creative Tools"), then in the blueprint browser (F10) you can select a blueprint and click Replace.

For mods or ingame scripts, if the folder doesn't contain a modinfo.sbmi then it will instead publish a new item, this can be fixed by [manually creating the modinfo.sbmi](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding/Tutorials/Creating_And_Uploading_Mods#Manually_creating_the_modinfo.sbmi "Modding/Tutorials/Creating And Uploading Mods").
