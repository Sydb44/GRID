The Willis Duct Grate is a decorative block in Space Engineers for large grid only. It looks like a flat cover lid that matches the opening of [Willis Ducts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Willis_Ducts "Willis Ducts") blocks.

## Usage

It is not animated and does not open -- you must grind it off to enter the duct behind. For Roleplaying, this means that the presence of an intruder or hidden fugitive could be revealed by spotting a grinded off Willis Duct Grate. In general, you can also use them for greebling (= decorating the surface) of any flat large block, such as boring armor cubes.

## Construction

The lid has rounded corners and two see-through grates. Visually, it takes up less than 2/3 of a LG block and does not cover the whole block side. As far as block placement is concerned, it takes up the whole 1x1x1 LG block space though.

Willis Duct Grates perfectly match the openings of [Willis Ducts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Willis_Ducts "Willis Ducts") and [Ladder Shafts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ladder_Shaft "Ladder Shaft"). Incidentally, they also match the text plus inventory port combo on Refineries, Reactors, Cargo Containers, Survival Kits, etc. They do not match the Viewport block (a similarly rounded window from the Wasteland DLC).
