The large-grid overhead suspension monorail is one of the striking features of the [Sparks of the Future](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sparks_of_the_Future_Scenario "Sparks of the Future Scenario") [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario"). Tram A is the red one of the two trams on this map, it's the one that connects Arrivals with SOTF Central. The interior is decorated with couches and railings.

## Special Features

Tram A travels along a monorail track, a straight stalk of blocks connecting Arrivals and Central. The tram car is loosely clamped to the monorail and it propells itself forward using four [Wheel 1x1s](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_1x1 "Wheel 1x1") that are attached side-ways on the roof, so the tires touch the rail on both sides.

The tram uses the [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") Autopilot to travel back and forth between two waypoints. It uses two [timer blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") and two Autopilot Actions to switch auto-pilot on/off, handbrake on/off, doors open/close, wheels on/off, and to restart the timers.
