# Farming - Official Space Engineers Wiki

When Food Consumption is enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), the most efficient way to not starve is to grow [Food](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food") in a [Farm Plot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Farm_Plot "Farm Plot") block.

Farmable food includes [mushrooms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mushroom "Mushroom"), [fruit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Fruit "Fruit"), [grains](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grains "Grains"), and [vegetables](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Vegetable "Vegetable"). To grow algae, use the [Algae Farm](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Algae_Farm "Algae Farm") instead!

## Farming Requirements

Make sure you are ready:

*   You have the seeds in your inventory.
*   You have one or more [Farm Plot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Farm_Plot "Farm Plot") blocks.
*   You have at least one [Irrigation System](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Irrigation_System "Irrigation System") block that contains a steady supply of [ice](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice").
*   The Farm Plot and Irrigation System block are conveyored to each others' ports.
*   The blocks must be [powered](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power").
*   The farm plots must be either in [pressurised](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") rooms or in atmosphere with moderate weather.
*   The farm plots must not be exposed to extreme weather or vacuum
*   No direct sunlight is needed. The Farm Plot has a built-in light source and works indoors and in zero gravity.
*   (Optionally) Leave space above the farm plots for a [Collector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector") to pass over them.

## How to plant crops

1.  [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click the Farm Plot with no tool in hand ([0 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")) to open a dialog box.
2.  Verify that it says:
    *   Crop type: None. (If it doesn't, some crop is already growing in it.)
    *   Water level: high. (If it doesn't, click Refresh, or ensure your Irrigation System works!)
3.  On the left side, select the seed in your inventory.
4.  Click **Plant**. The seed is removed from your inventory and planted.
5.  Close the window.

Wait until they are ready to harvest at Growth Progress: 100%.

## How to harvest food

To harvest:

1.  [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click the Farm Plot with no tool in hand ([0 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")) to open a dialog box.
2.  The dialog says, for example:
    *   Crop type: (Fruit/Grain/Mushroom/Vegetable)
    *   Water level: high
    *   Growth Progress: 100%
    *   Grow Time: hh.mm.ss
    *   Crop Health: 100%

If Grow Progress is 100%, click **Harvest**!

*   The crop is removed from the farm.
*   2-3 food items are added to your inventory.

If Growth Progress is not 100%:

1.  Don't harvest it yet!
2.  Close the window and return after the amount of time shown under Growth Time.
3.  If you left the dialog open, click Refresh to see new progress.

If Growth Progress is 100% but Crop Health is below 100%:

*   You can harvest it and receive a partial yield.

If the Water Level is not 100%:

*   Fill ice in the Irrigation System to save your crops before their health drops to zero!
*   Make sure a O2/H2 Generator doesn't pull all the ice, e.g. by using separate inventories or sorters.
*   Crops die when the water level is zero. No seed or harvest can be recovered then.
