Heals radiation poisoning

Anti-Radiation MedKit is a [consumable](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Consumable "Consumable") [item](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item") in Space Engineers that heals [radiation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Radiation "Radiation") sickness and gives radiation immunity for 10 mins. Engineers can carry it in their inventory and the MedKit fits through small conveyor ports.

> "Specialized medical supplies which prevent and reduce the effects of radiation for a time."

## Usage

You have two ways to use consumables from your inventory:

*   Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") config, go to the Consumables category, and assign the consumable to a toolbar slot. Press [ESCAPE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and then press the number key of the toolbar slot.
*   Or press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open your inventory and [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click the item there to consume it right away.

Applying a Anti-Radiation MedKit consumes the medikit and decreases the player's radiation exposure completely over time.
