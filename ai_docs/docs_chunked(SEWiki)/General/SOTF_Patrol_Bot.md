Two small-grid repair drones can be found patrolling the central asteroid of the [Sparks of the Future](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sparks_of_the_Future_Scenario "Sparks of the Future Scenario") [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario"). They use a Remote Control and a series of waypoints to patrol the outside areas. They have a few ion thrusters, a gyroscope, and one small reactor.

The welder on this tiny utility ship has been renamed to "Human Submission Tool".
