The Desk Corner is a large-grid decorative block. It can only be welded and placed by people who have purchased the [Decorative Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack "Decorative Pack") DLC, but it can be used by all players.

## Usage

The Desk Corner block is a tiny variant of the [desk](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Desk "Desk") block. It's a triangular desk and a chair in front of it. You can combine the Desks and Corner Desks so that another player can sit at the front end of the desk. It is made up of a plain, narrow desktop along on edge plus one seat. To enter the seat press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). It can charge the seated engineer's suit as long as the grid is powered. You can sit in this seat safely during a [jump](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive"). A similar block is Desk Corner.

## Construction

The Desk Corner takes up 1x1x1 large-grid blocks but leaves most of the space free to walk past.
