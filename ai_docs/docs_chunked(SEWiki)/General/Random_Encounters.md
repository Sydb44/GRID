**Random Encounters** (also known as “Exploration Ships”) are derelict ships and stations that are scattered across an infinite solar system, likely close to [asteroids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid"). You may also be interested in other types of [Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Encounters "Encounters").

## How to have random encounters?

You enable this exploration content in your game by enabling the **Random Encounters** checkbox in the _Advanced_ [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"). The _Random Encounters_ setting does not include _[SPRT Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates")_ and Pirate Stations, nor _Cargo Ships_, nor [Economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") Trading Outposts; [enable](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") these separately.

Random Encounters are triggered by your travel distance. This means they are not all immediately present in a newly created world when you explore it only as [Spectator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode") or [Admin](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen").

## PvE and Exploration gameplay

Random Encounters will blink a "Mayday" signal on your [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") for a 1-second interval every minute, from a 15-20km distance, and you have to “triangulate” (guess) their position.

While some of the ships are disabled or harmless, others can be powered, armed, and even hostile. [Large Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") and [stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Stations "Stations") can be explored and often hold valuable [resources](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ore "Ore") and [components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component") distributed throughout various containers that can be looted.

## Taking over wrecks

Derelict NPC ships are part of the shared NPC [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU") pool, meaning players' PCU is not used by them.

Once you interact with the wreck it will start the [NPC claim timer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Claim_NPC_Ship "Claim NPC Ship") which will make it vanish once the timer runs out unless a player claims that PCU for themselves and hacks the ship.

If you did claim it but no longer want it, in your personal [terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal")'s [Info tab](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen") (meaning, open the terminal while not interacting with a ship) you can:

*   Give it to other players through the "Assign Author" drop-down menu, however that player has to manually accept it.
*   Delete the grid by clicking the \[X\] button, however this might be disabled in world settings (default is allowed).

If you like the design, and conveyors and functional blocks are laid out well, it is possible to restore wrecks. However in some cases it may be a greater effort than it’s worth, and you should rather [salvage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder "Grinder") the components instead.

## History

The original random encounters have been built and published by the community in the 'Exploration" category on the Steam Workshop. See [Marek Rosa's December 2014 blog](http://blog.marekrosa.org/2014/12/space-engineers-exploration-call-for_3.html) for details.

The current encounters are not identical to the original legacy encounters, which have been removed. One example is the [IMDC Cerberus Destroyer Mk.3](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/IMDC_Cerberus_Destroyer_Mk.3 "IMDC Cerberus Destroyer Mk.3"). The complete list of pre-1.207 encounters can be found under [Old Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Old_Random_Encounters "Old Random Encounters").
