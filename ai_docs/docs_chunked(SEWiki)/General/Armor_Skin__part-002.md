## Why can't I select some of these armors skins?

If you notice that some textures are not available for you to select, it is because these variants are unlocked by purchasing [DLC](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC "DLC"). You can tell the difference by looking at the icons. For details, see [DLC Icons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC_and_Achievement_Icons "DLC and Achievement Icons").
