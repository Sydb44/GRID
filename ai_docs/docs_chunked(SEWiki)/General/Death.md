# Death - Official Space Engineers Wiki

A [player](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer") can die due to lack of [Life Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support"), [weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather"), [hunger](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food"), or by being shot, being blown up by explosions, crashing, falling, colliding with solid objects, or being hit by flying solid objects.

After the spacesuit runs out of oxygen or power in hostile environments, your health starts decreasing every second. Death occurs when a player reaches 0 health points. Dead players will hear a ringing sound in their ears, they drop their backpack (lose their [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory")), and have to respawn. When you die, you lose your accumulated positive [buffs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Buffs "Buffs").

## How to check your health

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/HUD_Part-_suit.png/320px-HUD_Part-_suit.png?91287d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:HUD_Part-_suit.png)

5) Player health, 6) Player nutrition, 7) Suit power, 8) Suit oxygen, 9) Suit hydrogen

You monitor your health, oxygen, and power levels in the bottom left of the [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD").

*   Player health
*   [Player nutrition](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food")
*   Suit [power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power")
*   Suit oxygen
*   Suit hydrogen / jetpack fuel

## Respawning

In [Sandbox Games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game"), you can customise and choose your start location.

Players respawn at either a [Survival kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_kit "Survival kit") or [medical room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") that they own or have permission to use by their [faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Faction "Faction").

*   Whether a location appears on the spawn screen as ready or not ready depends on the Autorespawn option in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").
*   If respawn points were destroyed, switched off, [hacked](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking"), or ran out of [power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power"), then they are not available.
*   If no respawn points remain, the players respawns in a [Starter drop pod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pods "Drop Pods") in a random location, like on their first day. Restarting in new pod will cause the previous pod to despawn (if it still exists).[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

When players respawn after death, they see their body location as a GPS marker. They need to decide whether it's worth it and realistically possible to travel there and retrieve their inventory. Tip: Use [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-click to automatically match speed of a drifting backpack with your jetpack. Depending on the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") of the [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") or server, the Engineer may or may not respawn with a jetpack and/or tools.

## Permadeath

As an optional challenge, you can enable Permanent Death in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"). This means that after you die once, you cannot return to that world and have to start over in a different world. Depending on the game settings in [multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer"), Permanent Death of a faction member leads to a loss of ownership of all previously built grids. This means that the remaining faction members have to reclaim a perma-dead player's grids before someone else does.
