The  [![Icon Block Interior Pillar.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/4/42/Icon_Block_Interior_Pillar.png/21px-Icon_Block_Interior_Pillar.png?6628d5)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Interior_Pillar "Interior Pillar") Interior Pillar is a decorative [block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block") in Space Engineers. Interior Pillars don't provide much structural support. They are thinner than all other blocks and visually present a light-weight contrast to the heavier look of other blocks.

## Usage

Interior Pillars can be used literally as pillars inside buildings, visually holding up [Steel Catwalks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Steel_Catwalk "Steel Catwalk") and such, or to decorate a wide but still sturdy-looking hallway within a ship or station.

On space stations and ships, Interior Pillars help hold [solar arrays](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel") together, or they help physically separate [Decoys](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decoy "Decoy") from the main grid.

A longer end-on-end chain of Interior Pillars can look like a taut wire or steel cable. You can use them for visually holding up a suspension bridge, or as visual supports that are counter-balancing protruding parts of a space station, and much more. You are not limited to placing them orthogonally along the grid, you can "stretch the cable" at any angle if you attach both ends to angled [Hinges](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hinge "Hinge"). (To connect the second end: Add a hinge head to the cable end, remove the second hinge head, and reattach the new head to the hinge.) Similarly, you can use Interior Pillars to stand in as "hanging" chains in planetary bases with gravity, to visually hang lights or other blocks from the ceiling. The emphasis is on "visual" support, because they do not really provide support in game terms, so make sure the structure is static, and already sturdy without them.

## Construction

Interior Pillars exist for large grid only. They can attach to other blocks on two ends.
