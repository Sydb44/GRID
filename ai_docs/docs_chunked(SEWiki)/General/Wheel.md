## Usage

The decorative Wheel block without [Wheel Suspension](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension "Wheel Suspension") is non-functional: It doesn't spin, its friction cannot be configured, and it is less robust than a [Wheel Suspension](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension "Wheel Suspension"). The wheel can be left partially unwelded on purpose to create a cylinder shape, or welded up as "spare tire" decoration.

## Tips

Don't use this block to build a wheeled vehicle, instead, build [Wheel Suspension](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension "Wheel Suspension") blocks, and the necessary functional wheels will be added automatically (if there is enough space)!

The Wheel itself has no [controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"). The Wheel Suspension control panel is where you configure friction, speed, angle, etc. There's also a button to re-add a functional wheel -- don't attempt to manually attach a Wheel block to a suspension.
