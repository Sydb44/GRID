## Description

This is well designed base with several floors. This is a well defended stronghold, approach with caution.

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

  
In front of the building is a platform with a hangar door and another turret. Inside is a storage area with barrels, cargo crates, weapon racks. Also on the ground floor seems to be breakroom (with a drink dispenser and tables), an office, and (around the corner) a kitchen. The rooms have windows. There's two ladders and there's also two staircases that lead up.

One staircase leads to the second floor, where the captain's office is, with more weapons and ammo. A catwalk crosses over the storage room below, to the living quarters on the other side of the second floor. There's a bathroom and two beds. Possibly, you find datapads with lore about the inhabitants or a plushie. The second staircase leads from the kitchen to the other side of the living quarters.

The breakroom ladder leads down to the basement [Willis Ducts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Willis_Ducts "Willis Ducts") that allow you to sneak under the storage area and to the base reactor.

The ladder next to the weapon rack leads up to a short catwalk above the storage area to a tiny viewing room with a button (that just opens/closes the gate).

On the outside, theres some narrow stairs and a ladder leading up to the roof.

## Defenses

The base tells you in the in-game chat when it has detected you and that it will defend itself. When you approach closer than 1km, it opens fire. The antenna will send drones after its enemies, such as the atmospheric B-4 Bastion Drones.

There's an Assault Cannon turret on the roof, a gatling turret, two outside interior turrets, and an antenna, that you need to neutralize.

## Loot

*   a few ores in barrels
*   a lot of ammo
*   some components
*   possibly one Prototech Fame
*   Plushie
