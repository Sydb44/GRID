# Building Tips - Official Space Engineers Wiki

This is a "Did you know...?" style checklist with which you can verify your Space Engineers [building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") knowledge, and hopefully also learn something new.

## For Beginners

Before you start building, as a beginner, make sure you are aware of the following concepts:

*   You start a [new game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_game "New game") by creating a [Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") or a [Sandbox Game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game").
*   You understand the difference between [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") and [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode").
    *   You prototype in Creative Mode but know that you need to test its power/gas usage in Survival Mode.
*   You have memorised the basic [Key Bindings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
*   You understand how to use the [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") and how to find blocks in the G-Menu.
    *   When you have selected a block from the toolbar, you know you are in [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode").
*   You understand what a "[Grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid")" is and know basic [Building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") rules regarding [power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power"), [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port"), [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"), block size, and [mobility](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mobility "Mobility").
    *   When going for looks and creativity, you consider building a hull and filling it with functional blocks. This approach is also common when building very large ships.
    *   When going for functionality and survivability, you consider building the functional blocks and wrapping them in a hull later. This approach is also common when building compact ships and remote-controlled drones.
*   You keep backups of grids by [creating blueprints](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") and uploading them to the [Workshops](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Workshop "Workshop").
*   In singleplayer, you check the [warnings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warning_Options "Warning Options") to avoid performance issues. In multiplayer you build within [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU") limits.

Tip: You can find definitions of words in the [Glossary](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Glossary "Glossary").

## For intermediate builders

Using a floating frame as guide for outlining interesting shapes

An intermediate player has acquired skills[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) such as:

*   In Survival Mode, you use cheap, unwelded blocks as quick **scaffolding**.
    *   On a planet, you build a static platform so you have a flat surface to work on.
    *   Or start building a temporary cuboid frame, lay out functional blocks and hull inside, and when the vehicle is finished, you grind off the frame.
    *   Or you drop an upright [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") onto the ground as the first block of a mobile grid. Building off a landing gear provides stability, and it can be unlocked (or ground off) later in a controlled fashion.
*   You plan ahead whether the grid's width should be an **odd or even number** of blocks. You know that the width influences whether you can place [Cockpit blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_block "Cockpit block") in the middle or not, and you understand that you cannot easily change the width later. On the other hand, you understand that asymmetric ships fly just as well.

*   You know that asymmetric thruster placement is allowed, because the game prevents tailspinning.
    *   On planetary-only ships, you know that downward atmospheric thusters can be substituted by the pull of gravity.
    *   With skilled use of [gyroscopes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope"), you could gently rotate the old [Drop Pod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pod "Drop Pod") that has thrust in only one direction and pilot it helicopter style.
*   When a rover crashes on its back in gravity, you know to use pistons as jacks, or unwelded battery blocks as counterweight, or gyroscope overrides to roll it right-side-up again.
*   To transfer items, connect inventory ports together and build a [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") with [Sorters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Sorter "Conveyor Sorter") and [Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector"). If the conveyor system is the defining feature of a new ship/base, build it first and design the ship/base around it.
*   You understand the [Life Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support") requirements of your crew and build long-range ships and vehicles accordingly.

Heavy Armor looks very different than Light Armor, even with the same texture

*   You know you can [colorize and texturize](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color") blocks for better looks or camouflage.
    *   Heavy armor textures look different than light armor textures
*   When taking over an enemy ship,
    1.  Find functional block in the ship and look at the construction tooltip.
    2.  [Hack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking") the block by grinding it below the functional line (blue horizontal mark in tooltip) and then re-welding it, so [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") is transferred to yourself.
    3.  Look for enemy-owned (listed in red font) functional blocks in the [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").

While building together with others on [Multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") servers:

*   You don't build excessively big as to not exceed your [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU") limit.
*   You understand that per-block [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") and [faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Faction "Faction") sharing settings determine whether your faction members, neutrals, or enemies can use a functional block that you added.

In Creative Mode:

*   You enable [Symmetry Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") to automatically place mirrored blocks along mirror planes.
*   Before copying grids, you consider that where you aim the crosshairs determines the pivot point for grid rotation after pasting.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)
*   Before pasting grids, you know to hover the ghost preview over an existing block to make it snap and align.
