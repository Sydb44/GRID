The Projector is a block that makes a [grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid")'s [blueprint](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") visible and weldable in the world. Welding up the projection lets players build grids quickly, so they do not have to place blocks manually from memory.

For a similar DLC block that can project a miniturized hologram as decoration, see [Console Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Console_Block "Console Block").

In this article, we use "[grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid")" as short word to mean space ships, rovers, space [stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Stations "Stations"), [mechas](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker") — anything you can build.

## Usage

### What's a projection?

The projection of a grid is original-sized, non-solid, and translucent like a hologram. Each projected block costs 1 [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU").

*   The projector's main strength is that the game treats projected blocks as unwelded placed blocks, which enables you to [weld](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder "Welder") up a blueprint quickly.
*   The projector's main weakness is its inability to project subgrids, you need to project subgrids separately.

A large projector projects large grids only; a small projector projects small grids only; a large projector on a station projects station grids only. Welding a projection uses up the same amount of materials than welding up manually placed blocks. You can use [handheld welders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_\(Tool\) "Welder (Tool)") or faster [block welders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_Block "Welder Block").

Related tips: If you ever need to attach a small subgrid to a large main grid, see [How to connect small and large grid blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/How_to_connect_small_and_large_grid_blocks "How to connect small and large grid blocks") for a workaround; if you ever need to convert a projected grid from station to mobile, see [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen").

### How to weld the projection

Tip: It can be beneficial to make your [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") transparent in the [Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options") so you can see the big picture better. Or sit in a optimally positioned control seat on the projector grid.

1.  Sit in a seat on the projector’s grid, or stand and interact with the projector’s Control Panel, respectively.
2.  Press [V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to switch into third-person view and use the scroll wheel to zoom out so you can see the build area.
3.  Press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to access the [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") of the projector.
4.  Click **Blueprint** and double-click a blueprint from the list. Now the projection appears.
5.  Zoom out to check whether the projection is in a stable position. Is the projection’s connector near an auto-locking connector? Does it have solid ground below its wheels? etc.
    *   Use the **Horizontal**, **Vertical**, and **Forward Offset** sliders to position the projection.
    *   Use the **Pitch/Yaw/Roll** sliders to rotate the projection, if needed.
6.  Optionally, enable **Show Only Buildable** to hide unsupported blocks, so you don't miss welding any blocks.
7.  Optionally, enable **Keep Projection** if you want to mass-produce the same thing, or repair the same ship repeatedly. If you produce many different things and choose a new blueprint every time, disable this checkbox.
8.  Press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the Control Panel.

Combine a projector with conveyored block welders to create and advanced assembly line or 3D printer (2014)

If you can't start welding up the projection now, the projected ghost blocks are "unsupported".

1.  Build a row of temporary armor blocks from the projector's grid until they touch ghost blocks of the projection. Touched blocks are supported blocks.
2.  Start welding the first supported block of the projection, which will highlight the next supported block to weld, and so on.
3.  Verify the grid won't fall, then cut loose the temporary row of blocks that have been supporting the welded grid.
4.  Finally, name the new grid on its [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen").

To improve performance, after you're done, click **Remove** to unload the blueprint, and switch off the projector while you're not using it.
