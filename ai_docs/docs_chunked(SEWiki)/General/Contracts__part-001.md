# Contracts - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Contracts can refer to [Contracts Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts_Block "Contracts Block") or to the Contracts game mechanic. Contracts as a game mechanic are player missions:

*   You accept Contracts from NPC-owned Contracts blocks found in NPC [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts").
*   On multiplayer servers, you can offer and accept Contracts from player-owned Contracts blocks in player-built stations.

You can choose to complete contract objectives...

*   to improve [faction reputation with NPCs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions"),
*   to track or find lost grids, or
*   to earn [Space Credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits").

In general, contracts are a good incentive for exploration and provide an element of roleplay.

## Prerequisites

[Economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") must be enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

You can _accept_ NPC contracts in singleplayer, but _offering_ contracts to others makes sense only on multiplayer servers, because NPCs don't accept your offered contracts.

## Usage

When you interact with a [Contracts Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts_Block "Contracts Block"), you see an interface with three tabs:

*   **Available Contracts** tab -- Lets you browse and accept contracts offered by the _block owner_ for this location. Pay attention to the success conditions, collateral, and failure penalties before accepting.
*   **Accepted Contracts** tab -- Lets you review your open contracts and their requirements. Shortcut [; key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
    *   After you fulfil the requirements, select the contract here and click **Finish** to get paid.
    *   Or you can **Abbandon** the selected contract here, at the cost of reputation and collateral.
*   **Administration** tab -- If you own the block on a multiplayer server, this tab is where you manage contracts that you offer to other players.

## Which contracts can I accept?

Tip: If you don't know what to pick as a beginner, choose a Search contract.

All contracts implicitly expect the contractor to bring their own specialised ships for the task! Some contracts are strictly time limited while others have no time limit and can be stacked. Some are tied to specific quest items ( [![Icon Item Package.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Package.png/21px-Icon_Item_Package.png?7bda1c)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package") [Package](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package")s) and you can lose a collateral if you fail, while for others, all you can lose is faction standing. Lower pay means easier.

| Name | Mission Description | Requirements | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Search** | Find a "lost" ship or cargo container in a few hundred metres radius around given coordinates. A ~25min countdown timer starts when you accept the contract.  <br>Planetary stations give local planetary coordinates; orbital and space stations give space coordinates; players can give any coordinates. | Only accept if you have a fast rover/ship.  <br>Approach the found target until you get a confirmation. NPC-owned targets then disappear, player-owned targets stay. No need to transport the found grid back. | NPC-offered Search contracts are good entry-level jobs. Player-offered Search contracts _could_ be traps. Don't queue up too many, you'll likely run out of time. |
| **Acquisition** | Someone wants to buy quantities of raw materials or components and you acquire and deliver them. Offered anywhere. | Only accept if your ship/rover has cargo space and connectors. You must [own](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") the ship/rover, connect to the neutral or friendly target station, and deliver all items at once. | Jobs vary from entry-level to mid-level difficulty. You can mine / refine / assemble, trade, or steal the requested items -- up to you. Don't accidentally bring ores if it asked for ingots. |
| **Escort** | Meet a flying NPC ship in space and escort it to given coordinates intact. Don't let it be destroyed by space pirate attacks! Only offered in orbital and space stations. | Only accept if you have a fightercraft. | You are allowed to arm and repair the NPC ship in flight at your own cost. |
| **Hauling** | You pay a collateral in exchange for a small item. Transport it to given coordinates to get paid and get your collateral back. If you lose the  [![Icon Item Package.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Package.png/21px-Icon_Item_Package.png?7bda1c)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package") [Package](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package"), you lose reputation and collateral. | Only accept if you have a ship with jump drive and a lander/shuttle, and money to pay the collateral. | See detailed notes about the package and collateral below. |
| **Repair** | Visit and repair a ship at given coordinates to gain reputation and payment. Only offered in orbital and space stations. (?) | Repairing up to the functional line is enough. Only accept if you have a [Constructor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") ship with a cargo hold full of components. | Don't weld by hand. |
| **Bounty** | NPCs ask you to hunt down and kill another player who has low [standing](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") with this NPC faction and high standing with the [SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") faction. The contract reveals the player's last known location. | Only accept if you have a fighter/weapons and enjoy PvP duels. Use a [handheld weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons") for the killing blow! | These contracts appear on PvP multiplayer servers only; they can be disabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") by the host. |
