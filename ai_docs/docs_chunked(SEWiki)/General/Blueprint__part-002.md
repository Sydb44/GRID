4.  Decide for each functional block whether you want it on or off.
5.  Important: Always switch off self-projectors.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)

Tip: If you want to check the point around which the blueprint rotates before you take a blueprint, open the [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen"), and enable the **Show [Grid Pivot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid_Pivot "Grid Pivot")** checkbox.

### How to name non-functional blueprints

When blueprinting, for example, a ready-to-weld wall or floor segment that has no cockpit and no terminal access, the problem is that you cannot open its [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen") to name it. How to work around that?

1.  Temporarily build a [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel "Control Panel") on that grid.
2.  Use that panel to access the grid's [Terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal"), open to the [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen"), and name the grid.
3.  Grind off the Control Panel. (!)
4.  Take the blueprint.

## How to create a blueprint

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Blueprints.png/320px-Blueprints.png?ba9999)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Blueprints.png)

To create a blueprint, aim the crosshairs at the grid and press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[B key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

If the grid has subgrids on rotors/pistons/hinges (this is called a multigrid), the blueprint also contains all subgrids.

*   To blueprint only a subgrid, press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[B key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") instead.  
    For example, use this when blueprinting a small-grid ship docked to a Connector of a large-grid station. You will also need separate subgrid blueprints to [project multigrids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") in Survival Mode.

*   To blueprint all connected grids [including magnetically locked](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") grids, use [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[ALT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[B key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") instead. Use this if you want to copy and paste a whole station or mothership including docked ships.

Why do you care about this distinction? You can _copy and paste_ multigrids in Creative Mode. But you cannot _project_ multigrids in Survival mode: Only one (sub)grid can be projected at a time. For details and mod workarounds, see [Projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector").

You have the option to upload blueprints to the [Steam Workshop or mod.io](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Workshop "Workshop"). Sharing blueprints this way does not only mean that other players can download them, but you yourself will be able to recover them if you should ever lose your local copies.

> **Do not copy another authorâ€™s work without permission, on Steam or mod.io, or anywhere else.**

Press [F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), select a blueprint and press the **Publish** button. You can choose between Steam and Mod.io[\[3\]](#cite_note-3) or both.

**Note:** Grids (and their blueprints) can contain DLC blocks and modded blocks. Whether you can successfully share a blueprint depends strongly on whether the recipient has the DLC and/or mod installed. DLCs appear as symbols on the recipient's Blueprints screen. Either hover the mouse over the symbol to read the tooltip, or check the symbols on the [DLC and Achievement Icons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC_and_Achievement_Icons "DLC and Achievement Icons") page. If the recipient projects or pastes a shared blueprint with unowned blocks, these blocks will be missing. Depending on what it is, they may be able to easily identify the missing blocks and replace them with non-DLC equivalents. If the missing DLC block was structural though, the pasted blueprint will [break in two](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block").

### How to send blueprints to players

Have a recommendation but you can't copy and paste the Steam link in game? You can send a published Workshop blueprint quickly to another player from inside the multiplayer game:

1.  Press [F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
2.  Select the Steam Workshop blueprint from the list.
3.  Select the recipient's name from the **Send To** menu. It lists player that are online on the same server.
4.  The recipient sees a message on screen, that <name> sent a workshop blueprint.
5.  The new blueprint will appear on the F10 screen of the recipient, on the bttom of the Steam Workshop category list. The recipient can double-click to open it on the Workshop and choose to subscribe to it.

## How to view and spawn blueprints

After making a blueprint, press [F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the Blueprint screen to view (and spawn in) your blueprinted grids. This works both in survival mode and creative mode, but there are important differences.

*   In creative games [with copy&paste enabled](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), you can copy blueprints directly from the blueprint screen and paste them into the world without any costs. Pasting includes connected grids and subgrids.
*   In survival games, you must build a [Projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") to make the blueprint visible in the world, and then you must spend components and time to weld it up. Projectors however do not support projecting [connected grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") or [subgrids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") -- read about details on the respective pages.
*   [Admins](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") with creative tools enabled can also allow themselves to copy and paste blueprints into a survival world.

If the blueprint contains DLC blocks or modded blocks that the player does not have access to, then they cannot paste/project the blueprint fully. If another player builds the DLC blocks for them, and transfers ownership of the grid to them, they can use it normally.

Required mods must always be installed to be able to paste/project blueprints that use them.
