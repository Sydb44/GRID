| You step out of the pod and scan the moon surface. The sun is above you and the Earthlike planet at the horizon. Behind you, your pod is nose-down in the regolith. A short distance away, just above the horizon, you spot the tower of a moonbase, and you head for it. | Press [X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to use your [jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") to reach the tower faster.  <br>In your HUD, note the red status hints warning that there is no oxygen and it's freezing--your space suit and (closed) helmet protect you. |
| Outside the [ROS-4](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") base, you first notice a crashed drill ship. Everything here seems deserted. There's a tall tower, a partially broken solar array, a closed hangar with a broken moon rover inside, an empty vehicle platform outside, and a huge closed blast door in the ground. You see glass tunnels leading to pressurised rooms, and to a second, shorter tower building. A bit further away, you spot a locked building with an antenna on top next to a smaller blast door; inside, you glimpse a passage to a staircase down.  <br>You decide to explore the base and find a way deeper into the deserted facility. You enter the "Moon base lobby" through the highlighted door. |     |
| In the lobby, you see a door to the garage and a door to the control tower. A locked door goes back outside towards the tall tower.<br><br>Optional: Go through the door labeled "garage" to the moon rover hangar. There is a button to open the hangar door to go out onto the moon surface. The vehicle cockpit is too damaged to drive and it's missing two wheels.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) A cargo container provides bottles and weapons, if needed.<br><br>Go through the door that says "control tower/life support" and through a glass tunnel. Now you can go three ways: To Life Support, to Elevator, or to Control Tower.<br><br>Optional: Go into the Life Support room to recharge your suit energy, if needed.<br><br>Go to the Elevator. You find that the elevator is locked.<br><br>Go to the Control Tower to lift the security lockdown. On your way upstairs, you see a low building with an antenna through the window. Upstairs, you push the button that unlocks the blast door below. |     |
| Cutscene: the large blast door opens and reveals a deep cylindrical shaft down. You also notice that the stuck elevator door opens. |     |
| The AI wonders why the main shaft is so deep. It wants you to find an explanation and asks you to investigate the excavation site in the tunnels. | Press [L key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle your suit lights. |
| Go downstairs and return to the elevator room. Enter the elevator and push the button. The elevator goes down and you see the deep shaft from the inside. When the door opens, you're in an underground cavern with cargo, batteries, tanks, medical room, and three passages. You look up to see the main shaft above you. In a side room, you spot four automatic defense drones — the AI indicates they are offline.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) |     |
| Explore the three passages.  <br>Along one tunnel uphill, you find a half-open room with a view down into a large chamber. Here you find a dead body, cryopods, a medical room, and a reactor. On a screen you see a log message by a worker worried about a colleague who was mesmerized by what they found in the artefact chamber down here, and equally worried about their own stress levels. | You can find dead bodies, better rifles, more ammo, some more offline mining drones, and explosives. Remember you have a jetpack. Activate the reactor by transferring ([I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") uranium from the cargo container nearby to the reactor to enable cryopods for yourself. |
| In the artefact chamber, you see a hole, another abandoned mining drone, two more defense drones, a spotlight, and a projector with a button panel. The log message on a screen nearby says that the artefact has already been extracted and sent to the research team at their main base. Push the button on the central platform. |     |
| Cutscene: A projection shows a 3D scan of the mysterious artefact--It is long gone. Suddenly, the defense drones and mining drones activate.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3) |     |     |
| Shoot the drones down or simply flee through the tunnels back towards the exit marker. Back at the tunnel entrance, you see the blast doors above you close shut. The remaining defense drones activate.  <br>Run for the elevator and push the button. Halfway up, the AI stops the ascend and opens the door at a maintenance level. Exit the elevator and go through the maintenance door. | Press a number key to select the rifle in your toolbar and click to shoot. In the hallway, you find more ammo and bottles, if needed. |
| Follow the marker to the last remaning spaceship. A watchful red eye spots you — defeat its turret to proceed. | Press a number key to select the rifle in your toolbar and click to shoot. |
| You reach an underground bunker. The bunker is actually below the small antenna building you saw on the moon surface earlier. Downstairs inside the bunker is a rocket at the bottom of the second, smaller cylindrical shaft. Approach the rocket docked over the platform and enter the cockpit. Above you, you see blast doors open. | Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to sit in the cockpit. Press [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to unlock landing gears to ready the ship. Hold [W key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to lift up in the rocket. |
| You escape and fly towards the "Nav Comp coordinates" marker, where you encounter the yellow fleet. The yellow faction explains their side of the story: They are not the enemy of [Sol Cooperative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative") and were not shooting at _you_. You just got caught in the crossfire between the [Independent Terran Workers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Independent_Terran_Workers "Independent Terran Workers") (ITW, yellow) and [Results Oriented Sciences](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") (ROS, red). ROS unscrupulously eliminated the hired ITW workers after they excavated a valuable [artefact](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Monolith "Monolith") under the ROS-4 base. The remaining ITW workers want to prevent ROS from exploiting the artefact. They take you to their settlement on the Earthlike planet below. |     |

| --- | --- |Mission 3: the Ruined Camp
| Story | Learn how to... |
| Setting: A ruined camp on the Earthlike planet  <br>Cutscene: During the flight, you hear that your new allies, ITW, are settlers who took on a contract with the ROS corporation. ROS then unscrupulously attacked the ITW settlement to leave no witnesses of the artefact's discovery. The settlers are in possession of a broken frigate and a de-powered base. They need an engineer --you-- to help them repair, so they can take revenge. |     |
| You exit the drop ship, which then leaves. In the ITW settlement, you see tents, and a garage with a rover, a broken solar panel and a misaligned solarpanel. The camp is riddled with craters and holes. Broken thrusters, molten reactors, and burning decoys all strewn about. Your suit AI points out the repairs needed (solar panels) and containers with spare parts. |     |
| Optional: In one of the tents you find a button that loads a log message on the screen that describes how the ITW settlers had to flee from an attacking ROS fleet after completing their excavation contract.<br><br>Optional: At the edge of the base you find a broken small ship and a dead body with a log message on a display next to him. This settler returned to rescue survivors and was killed by a swarm of ROS drones.<br><br>Optional: You also find a grinder pit with a sign warning that it is not to be used. Downstairs, when you push a button, the grinder starts chasing you around. You can hide under floorboards and escape through stairs. | (Optional exploration.) |
| In one tent, you find spare parts. You may need to go back and fetch more spare parts if they did not fit in your inventory. After the battery is built, it kickstarts the solar panels to align properly again, and restores power. | Take components from the container ([I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Add the block to your toolbar ([G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Click to place the block at the marked location. Select the welder as your Character Tool (press a number key). (If the tutorial does not proceed, try holding another welder instead.) Click to weld up the block with the spare parts in your inventory and welder in hand. |
| Use the elevator to enter the ITW camp's hangar. Downstairs, you see the damaged frigate. Follow the marker to the control station. Upstairs, you find the ITW chief engineer's log, who says he has completed all repairs except for the last thruster. You push the button in the control station and find out that the frigate also needs fuel (uranium) from a highlighted container. Then take the uranium to the frigate and place it into the highlighted reactor. | Refuel a reactor ([I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Pick up ([F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")) hydrogen bottles in case your jetpack runs out. |
| Follow the markers to fetch a grinder and put it on your toolbar to use it. Use the grinder to salvage components from the marked wrecked thruster, then weld the marked frigate thruster to repair it.  <br>Follow the markers to the hydrogen tanks and push the buttons to refuel, then push the button to disconnect the fuel line again.  <br>Finally, you return upstairs to the control station and push the button to open the roof hangar doors. You return to the frigate and sit in the flight seat and fly up towards the highlighted rendevous point. | Press number keys to switch tools and click to salvage (grind) and repair (weld). Refuel hydrogen. Toggle between 1st and 3rd person view ([V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Lift off in a frigate (press [SPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). |
| Cutscene: You join the ITW (yellow) faction's attack on the ROS (red) faction's frigate. You use the button to control one of the rocket launchers and shoot at the highlighted weak points on the red frigate. You did it! You helped the settlers, and the evil corporation retreats! For now. |     |
