*   You cannot refill your ship's power or gas for free. [Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") on Trading Outposts are in **Trading Mode** which disables inventory/control panel access and power/gas transfer between the trader's connector and your docked ship. Only  [![Icon Block Store.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/2/2b/Icon_Block_Store.png/21px-Icon_Block_Store.png?1936a5)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") transactions are allowed to buy gas (select a target tank). After undocking, there is an interval when players cannot immediately connect to the same Trading Station again.

You will be able to interact with DLC blocks in the stations regardless of whether or not you own the Economy Deluxe DLC.

## How to get discounts

If your reputation with a faction is above 500, you can get buy discounts up to 10% and sell bonuses up to 5%.

**Tips:**

*   Complete contracts to increase your reputation.
*   Be careful when dealing with other factions, as damaging their grids will lower your reputation with allies.
*   If you manage to find a [SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") Trading Outpost, you can get great discounts by attacking neutral NPCs grids, thus increasing your SPRT reputation (at the cost of your reputations with all other initially neutral factions).

## Which NPC Factions Own Outposts?

When a [world with Economy enabled](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") is generated, a dozen random [NPC Factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions") are also generated. Space Pirates (SPRT) and these randomly generated factions own the Trading Outposts that the player will come across. After an NPC ship or Trading Outpost appears on your radar ([HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD")), you have "discovered" this faction and their name is revealed in the list in your faction screen. By their names, you can distinguish different [types of NPCs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions"): miners, traders, builders, military, and pirate.

## What's that force field?

Every trading outpost is protected by an [Admin Safe Zone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") which prevents damage and stops players from using tools and weapons inside. You cannot repair your ship inside a trading save zone.

*   Players whose faction reputation with the outpost's NPC faction is too low (due to piracy against that faction or their allies) are denied access into the safe zone and cannot trade or accept contracts at the outpost.
*   Neutral players can enter the safe zone, trade, and accept contracts.
*   Players whose faction reputation is high (due to completing contracts for the faction and their allies) can enter, accept contracts, and trade prices improve by ~10% for them!

NPC stations contain no actual  [![Icon Block Safe Zone.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/4/41/Icon_Block_Safe_Zone.png/21px-Icon_Block_Safe_Zone.png?a32135)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone") [Safe Zone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone") block that could be deactivated as part of pirate gameplay!

## Can I Occupy or Raid Outposts?

It is not officially intended to raid or occupy a trading outpost in Survival Mode.

Many of them are not really worth it:

*   There is a buffer zone around planetary Trading Outposts where no ores spawn[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) on unexplored ground. This may be a reason to avoid setting up a new base right next to an outpost.
*   The trade goods are not actually in the station cargo. The only noteworthy loot found on the outposts is a little [Space credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits") cash, anywhere between 200 and 1000 and sometimes 200 uranium ingots depending on which outpost model it is, even if they are exempt of using fuel.
*   There are multiple [Decorative DLC](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC_and_Achievement_Icons "DLC and Achievement Icons") blocks in trading outposts which will only yield components when grinded down by a player who also has the DLC installed.

You can cheat using [admin controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") such as 'Ignore safe zones' and 'access all terminals' or exploits, but overall, it’s not really worth it. To loot them in survival mode as admin, first access a control panel and turn the station into a ship. Next, smash them out of the safe zone with your ship (don’t worry about damage to your ship or to the station given that damage is disabled in safe zones). When the station is out of the safe zone, you are free to loot it.

## Trivia

It is possible to see NPC [Cargo Ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cargo_Ships "Cargo Ships") pass by stations.

Trading Outposts can sell any ore and component, this lets you potentially get rare resources like Uranium and Platinum from any planet or moon.

SPRT Trading Outposts are harder to find as [Data Pads](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Data_Pads "Data Pads") only give gps markers of factions which the station is neutral or friendly with, once you find the first one you can easily find more by using the [Data Pads](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Data_Pads "Data Pads") you can buy there.

In contrast to the common traders, builders, miners, military, and pirates, only [The Unknown](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Unknown "The Unknown") and [The Factorum](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Factorum "The Factorum") do not have any Trading Outposts.
