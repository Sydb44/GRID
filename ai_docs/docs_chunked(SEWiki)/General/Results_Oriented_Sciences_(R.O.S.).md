**Results Orientated Sciences** (R.O.S. or ROS) is a privately owned company and one of the [NPC Factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions"). From the [The First Jump Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_First_Jump_Scenario "The First Jump Scenario"), we know that their Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is named Marcus. ROS are well known for their use of advanced mining and defense drones.

The Results Orientated Sciences Division-4 (R.O.S.4) is a company that develops technology for deep space, in deep space.

The ROS color scheme is a flat pure red, with titanium white highlights, and sometimes a black engraving.

## Lore

The CEO Marcus and R.O.S.4 drones appear as antagonists in the [The First Jump Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_First_Jump_Scenario "The First Jump Scenario") where the Engineer protagonist gets pulled into investigating the recent attacks on a [SOL](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative") space station. ROS lost favour with their former allies [ITW](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Independent_Terran_Workers "Independent Terran Workers"), due to ROS' criminal and unscrupulous behaviour.

A ROS operated drone production facility is the central setting of the [Frostbite Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Frostbite_Scenario "Frostbite Scenario"). The ROS Triton station made the news after ROS staff refused to weaponise drone technology. During the riot, many ethical ROS employees perished.

The original underground infrastructure of Sunset Valley in the [Lost Colony Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lost_Colony_Scenario "Lost Colony Scenario") has also been built by ROS, and was later abandoned and repurposed by [AGI](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Argonaut_Industries "Argonaut Industries") with inadvertently devastating consequences.

## Trivia

In real life, the names „Marcus“ and „R.O.S.4“ could allude to Marek Rosa, the CEO and founder of Keen Software House, the game studio which created Space Engineers.
