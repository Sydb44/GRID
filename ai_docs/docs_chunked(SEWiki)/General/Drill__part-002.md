### How to dig out a wreck

If you want to dig out an NPC encounter wreck, you often have the problem that drills destroy blocks. A drill will damage grids but will not destroy the grid it is built on.

So instead of drilling the ground from the outside:

1.  Build the drill, a seat, and a power source _on_ the wreck!
2.  Sit in the seat and hold [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") to clear out the stone surrounding the wreck.
3.  Then grind off and rebuild the drill to reach more areas, repeat.

## Power

A single Drill uses 2 kW of power while it is running. It does not matter if it is in contact with stone or not.

## Inventory

The block drills have a built-in inventory with a capacity of 3,375L on small ships and 23,437.5L on large ships and stations. This inventory will only accept [ore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ore "Ore") type items. Drills will send push requests for all of their contents through [Conveyor systems](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system").[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

## Construction

The drill can be built on large ships, small ships, and stations.

The small ships' drill is 3x3x6 small-grid cubes big, while the on large ships it is 1x1x3 large-grid blocks (meaning, they are the same size). Minimising the gap between the drills is important: two small drills can be separated by a single small-grid block without problem, but with the large drill, any gap is enough to allow stray voxel material to get between the drills, preventing them from boring deeper — or even damaging them.
