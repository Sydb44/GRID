## How to transfer items between player <-> station <-> ship

For you to be able to drag and drop items between different inventories in the inventory screen, they must be [connected through the conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") and not be size or type restricted ([see](#Item_Size_Restrictions) [below](#Item_Type_Restrictions)).

The Inventory tab has two columns. For each side you have two choices:

*   Show character inventory, or
*   Show connected inventory (on ships or stations)

By default, you see the engineer's inventory on the left side, and the current grid's inventory on the right side.

Having two columns allows you to drag and drop items from one conveyored inventory to another. If you click **show connected inventories** on either side, you can move items from one container to another, drop off loot, exchange oxygen bottles, or unload a connected ship. Simply scroll each side so you see the respective containers, or use the filters.

## How to access the station inventory from outside

You will often need to access your base inventory from the outside, especially while building or docking.

Build a conveyor tube from your cargo containers through the outside wall and cap it with a [Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector"). Connectors can transfer inventories between ships and stations, and at the same time, they offer an inventory [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") for players.

## Accessing Unconveyored Inventories

Some containers do not have [conveyor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port"), or maybe you just haven't welded the conveyors yet. But you still want to transfer items from there into the station.

In this case, transfer the items from the inventory into the engineerâ€™s inventory first, and then from yours to the target container. You may have to do it in several steps.

Many decorative blocks do not have any conveyor ports, but have small isolated inventories: For example, [Passenger Seat](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Passenger_Seat "Passenger Seat"), [Freight](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Freight_1 "Freight 1"), [Locker](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lockers "Lockers"), [Bed](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Bed "Bed"), [Armory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Armory "Armory"), and [Armory Lockers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Armory_Lockers "Armory Lockers"). You cannot drag and drop items from unconveyored inventories into conveyored inventories. You can only press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") on them to access them directly, and drag and drop items into your personal inventory.

**Tip:** When you interact with these unconveyored stand-alone containers, the inventory tab defaults to showing the character inventory on the right side. Remember to toggle **Show connected inventory** to see the _container's_ contents on the right side!

## How to split stacks

If you have multiples of the same items, they come in stacks. You can split stacks by [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") clicking the stack, and then [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-dragging the stack to an empty inventory slot.

The target slot can be in the same inventory or in a connected inventory. When you drop the stack, a dialog opens that says "Amount to add"; enter a value smaller than the total (or use the plus and minus buttons).

The value that you enter is the amount that is transferred to the new slot. The remainder of the stack stays behind in its old slot.

## How to filter and search inventories

[![inventory tab](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Terminal-inventory-for-grids.png/320px-Terminal-inventory-for-grids.png?61abcd)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Terminal-inventory-for-grids.png)

On the inventory tab, click the icons to filter inventories by type, or use the searchbar

In large grids, the long inventory list gets unwieldy. Thankfully, there are filters that help you find items more quickly.

The following filters are mutually exclusive:

*   **Show All Types of Inventories** (checkbox icon)  
    The inventory tab shows everything. This is the default.
*   **Filter Energy Inventories** (lightning icon)  
    Show only inventories of reactors and h2 engines.
*   **Show only inventories of the current ship** (rocket icon)  
    Hides connected inventories that can be accessed through [Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector"), [Advanced Rotors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Advanced_Rotor "Advanced Rotor"), [Hinges](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hinge "Hinge"), Pistons. Use this filter to concentrate on the current ship or station without being distracted by docked ships.
*   **Filter storage inventories** (box icon)  
    Show only Cargo Containers, and blocks with inventories such as Passenger Seats, Cockpits, Lockers, Collectors, Connectors, Ejectors, Safe Zones.
*   **Filter system inventories** (gear icon)  
    Show only production and functional blocks like Assembler, Refinery, Grid Tools, Tanks, Survival Kits, Turrets, Generators, Engines.

**Search**  
Type in a block name to list only inventories with names that contain this word as a substring. Tip: You can rename blocks and add your own keywords to make them quickly findable.

**Hide Empty**  
A toggle whether to list empty inventories. Enable this if you are searching for what is there. Disable this when you are looking for free space to transfer items into.
