# Encounter Vulture Vessel - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Rarely when you approach the "SPRT.Mayday" signal, you will meet the The Vulture. This ominous ship is owned by the [SPRT Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") and is one of the more dangerous [Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters").

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

  
This is a PvE battle encounter where you get attacked and chased by a pirate fighter.

The Vulture is giving chase

The Pirate Vulture immediately calls in 2-3 small Vulture Drones for assistance that you have to get rid of as well. The Vulture Drones have limited hydrogen for their thrusters and limited ammo for two gatling guns. Their only cargo is ice to feed the O2/H2 Generator (they have no tanks).

Pirate Vulture Vessel calling in a Vulture Drone

The Vulture itself attacks with two rocket launchers, two lateral turrets, and two interior turrets.

When you board the Vulture Vessel, it will try to buck you off by flying crazy manoeuvres until you [hack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking") or destroy the remote control block and cockpit.

## Interior

The interior has a cockpit in front and a battle room in the back, with a [projector table](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Console_Block "Console Block") and a desk with chairs and beds for a crew of two.

## Properties

The ship has 366 blocks and uses up 4233 PCU if you repurpose it for your own fleet. Or, you can salvage Hydrogen Thrusters, Oxygen Tanks, an O2/H2 Generator, a Survival Kit, some rockets and ammo, and an artificial gravity generator.
