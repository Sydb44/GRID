### How to View Altimeter and Attitude

While seated in the cockpit of a mobile grid in _natural gravity_, a cockpit indicates attitude (horizon) and altitude (height) on your [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"). If it doesn't, enable the **Show Horizon and Altitude** toggle in the cockpit's Control Panel.

*   The **artificial horizon** near your crosshairs shows your pitch and roll, angles which are often hard to tell without a reference point.
*   Your **altitude in metres above ground** is displayed in the middle of the HUD, as a number below the crosshairs. Knowing your height above the terrain is relevant when landing and flying to avoid collisions.

Note that the Cockpit HUD does not display your height above non-terrain structures (such as stations or landing pads), nor your height above sea level. You can't use the altitude to know how deep into the atmosphere you are and how effective your Atmospheric Thrusters will be.

**Tip:** You can also display artificial horizon, altitude, attitude, and angular momentum, on any of the built-in [LCDs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Surface_Options "LCD Surface Options") in your cockpit.

### How to Set Up Alarms and Countermeasures

The cockpit can trigger an automatic reaction when it detects a hostile [target lock](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Target_Locking "Target Locking") on the grid.

For example, you can configure it to switch on defensive AI turrets, or to play an [audible alarm](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sound_Block "Sound Block"), or to switch on red lights, or to release a merge block that drops [decoys](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decoy "Decoy"), ... Similarly, configure it to switch off your custom “Red Alert” as soon as you break out of target lock.

This is how:

Click **Set up Actions** to select from the available actions:

*   The action in the first slot triggers when you are targeted.
*   The action in the second slot triggers when you have broken out of target lock.

If you want to trigger more than one action, select a [Timer Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") as action, and set up the desired toggle actions inside the Timer block.

### Do cockpits maintain Life Support?

Cockpits offer passive life-support functionality to seated players:

*   Being seated recharges your suit power. An unpowered seat maintains suit power indefinitely but doesn't recharge it.
*   Sitting in an open cockpit in an airtight room, or in a closed cockpit conveyored to a source of oxygen, recharges your suit oxygen while seated.
*   Open cockpits in low oxygen environments do not recharge your oxygen.

## Construction

The Control Seat can be built on small and large grids. It is not airtight, it has no windows and no conveyor [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port").

The small-grid version is 2x3x3 small blocks in volume, and the large-grid variant takes up 1x1x1 large blocks but visually it fills only half this volume. The small grid variant has one, and the large-grid five [LCD Surfaces](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Surface_Options "LCD Surface Options") of varying sizes that can be customized.
