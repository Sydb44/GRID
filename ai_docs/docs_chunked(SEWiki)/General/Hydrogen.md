Hydrogen is a gas that can be transported through both [large and small conveyors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"). It is an important resource to fuel thrusters, to generate [power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power"), and to recharge [jetpacks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack").

*   The advantage of Hydrogen as propellant is that it allows for movement in both atmospheres and space.
*   The disadvantages are that it requires voluminous storage, it is explosive, and is relatively slow to produce.

## Uses

Hydrogen is used as fuel for

*   [Hydrogen Thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Thruster "Hydrogen Thruster") to fly,
*   [Hydrogen Engines](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Engine "Hydrogen Engine") to generate power, and
*   the engineer's [jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") to fly.

## Creation

You obtain hydrogen by supplying a powered [O2/H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") with  [![Icon Item Ice.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/9/9a/Icon_Item_Ice.png/21px-Icon_Item_Ice.png?f8a728)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice") [Ice](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice").

A second option is buying hydrogen at [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"), either to refill your space suit reservoir or you select tanks on a docked ship as the target.

## Storage

You store Hydrogen in [hydrogen tanks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Tank "Hydrogen Tank") in ships and bases, portable [hydrogen bottles](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Bottle "Hydrogen Bottle"), and in small amounts in an engineer's suit reservoir.

Damaged filled hydrogen tanks leak and cause [explosion damage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics "Damage Mechanics") when shot at.
