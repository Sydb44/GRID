Some blocks can be used for other purposes than the civilian purposes they were originally intended for: Booby traps are mechanisms designed to incapacitate, damage, or destroy a ship, station, or player by surprise, usually triggered by some action or sensor.

[Block Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") with targeting AI have the same effect and can be part of booby traps, but are not included here, because damage is their main purpose.

Some anti-space-piracy traps are built into pre-built NPC ships in the game, and in multiplayer, traps may be introduced by players for PvP purposes.

This page is a VERY spoiler-heavy one. Please don't click the expand button unless you really want to know! This is all meant to be learned through in-game experience.

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!
