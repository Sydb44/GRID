# Wolves - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![Wolves.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Wolves.png/320px-Wolves.png?b95ec7)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Wolves.png)

**Wolves** are hostile terrestrial NPCs. If enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") (enabled by default in [Star System](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Star_System "Star System")), wolves will spawn on the [EarthLike Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EarthLike_Planet "EarthLike Planet").

## Description

Wolves can be killed by [Block Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") and handheld [weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons"). After being killed, you have a short timespan to loot their corpses for [Mammal Meat (Raw)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mammal_Meat_\(Raw\) "Mammal Meat (Raw)").

## Behavior

Wolves spawn either alone or in a pack of 2 or 3 around players in the [EarthLike Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EarthLike_Planet "EarthLike Planet").

They are initially aggressive to players, but start to flee once their Health reach a certain threshold or another wolf dies.

Wolves can either attack in place or do a short lunge attack to hit players away from them.

## History

*   Update 1.207 - Apex Survival: Wolves were changed to have an overall better AI and drop [Mammal Meat (Raw)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mammal_Meat_\(Raw\) "Mammal Meat (Raw)"). Also, they no longer chew on grids.
*   Wolves used to be [Cyberhounds](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cyberhounds "Cyberhounds") in earlier versions of the game.

## Trivia

*   In creative mode, a player can use a [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") to turn their engineer into a wolf.
