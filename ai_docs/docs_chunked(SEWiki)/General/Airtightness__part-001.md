# Airtightness - Official Space Engineers Wiki

An airtight room is an [oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") filled grid interior in which engineers can [survive](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support") with their helmets open, even outside of a [planetary](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") atmosphere.

## Pressurised rooms

Pressurized rooms allow [engineers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer") to survive without using up the oxygen and electricity reservoirs of their suit. If "Auto-healing" is enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), player health slowly increases in pressurised rooms as well.

Similarly, the engineer can also survive inside enclosed [cockpits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_block "Cockpit block") as long as oxygen is provided to it with [conveyors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system").

## How to get oxygen

On planets with atmospheres containing oxygen, the accessible amount of oxygen is unlimited and can be collected with Air Vents that are set to Depressurize mode. Otherwise, oxygen has to be either generated from  [![Icon Item Ice.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/9/9a/Icon_Item_Ice.png/21px-Icon_Item_Ice.png?f8a728)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice") [Ice](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ice "Ice") in an  [![Icon Block O2 H2 Generator.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/7e/Icon_Block_O2_H2_Generator.png/21px-Icon_Block_O2_H2_Generator.png?60936f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") [O2/H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator"), or generated from sunlight with  [![Icon Block Oxygen Farm.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/5/57/Icon_Block_Oxygen_Farm.png/21px-Icon_Block_Oxygen_Farm.png?d55878)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Farm "Oxygen Farm") [Oxygen Farms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Farm "Oxygen Farm").

## How to build airtight rooms

[![minimal example of an airtight interior](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/9/99/Space-engineers-airtight-interior.png?effd0f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Space-engineers-airtight-interior.png "minimal example of an airtight interior")

When [building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") airtight rooms using an [Air Vent](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Air_Vent "Air Vent"), consider the following rules:

**1\. Walls:**

*   Airtight interiors can be built in any shape and size, but must be fully enclosed by solid faces of airtight blocks.
*   Closed Cockpits (that is, not open Rover and Buggy Cockpits) count as self-contained, single-block airtight interiors.
*   Voxels (the planet or asteroid surface) are not airtight!

**2\. Airlocks:** A pressurised room with a single closed door can technically be airtight, but without an airlock, it will be extremely wasteful of oxygen and power every time the door opens.

*   Airtight rooms need airlocks so engineers can exit and enter without venting (wasting) the oxygen.
    *   The simplest airlock is a pair of closed  [![Icon Block Sliding Door.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/0/0a/Icon_Block_Sliding_Door.png/21px-Icon_Block_Sliding_Door.png?364c7b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sliding_Door "Sliding Door") [Sliding Doors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sliding_Door "Sliding Door") back to back. Engineers open and close the first door, then open and close the second door. The room stays pressurised and loses only two blocks’ worth of oxygen.
    *   You can optimise a custom-built airlock to depressurise itself and not lose any oxygen.
*   Airlock opening and closing can be automated with [sensors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor") and [Timers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block").

**3\. Air Vents:**

*   Airtight rooms need at least one [Air Vent](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Air_Vent "Air Vent") block in their wall to be pressurized. Several air vents are faster together.
*   The Air Vent must be facing into the room, must be powered, and must be conveyored on the back to an oxygen supply (a filled oxygen tank, H2/O2 Generator, or Oxygen Farm).
*   To fill the room with oxygen (that is, to “pressurise” it), switch "Depressurize" off in the Vent’s control panel.

From simplistic O2 wasting builds to the highly complex oxygen conserving multi-part airlock, many variations exist and they can get very complex, very quickly.

## Blocks That Are Airtight

*   Interior walls, full armor cubes, 1x1x1 cargo containers, conveyor junctions, conveyor sorters, blast door block, ...
*   Both assemblers, large O2/H2 generator, jump drives, merge blocks, timers, parachute hatch, small artificial mass, collector, batteries, small hydrogen tank, ...
*   Doors form an airtight seal when closed; the  [![Icon Block Sliding Door.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/0/0a/Icon_Block_Sliding_Door.png/21px-Icon_Block_Sliding_Door.png?364c7b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sliding_Door "Sliding Door") [Sliding Doors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sliding_Door "Sliding Door") bring their own airtight side walls with them, other doors don’t.
