### How to update a published item

Simply publish the same entry again and it should override the previously published item. There are bugs around this so always check if it published a new item instead.

To first update a local blueprint, you can copy the ship in [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") or [Creative Tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Tools "Creative Tools"), then in the blueprint browser (F10) you can select a blueprint and click Replace.

For mods or ingame scripts, if the folder doesn't contain a modinfo.sbmi then it will instead publish a new item, this can be fixed by [manually creating the modinfo.sbmi](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding/Tutorials/Creating_And_Uploading_Mods#Manually_creating_the_modinfo.sbmi "Modding/Tutorials/Creating And Uploading Mods").

### How to change the preview image

Before publishing (or updating), open the folder where the item is, start from `%APPDATA%\SpaceEngineers\` (paste in address bar) and from there:

*   Saves\\ folder for worlds
*   Blueprints\\Local\\ folder for blueprints
*   IngameScripts\\Local\\ for ProgrammableBlock scripts
*   Mods\\ for local mods

You will find a thumb.jpg or thumb.png which you can modify, if not there you can create it.  
Make sure the final image is under 1MB in size (Steam's requirement) and at least 512x288 in resolution (mod.io's requirement).

## Where did the plugins go?

Plugins are community-created unrestricted mods for the PC platform that can add complex and advanced features. All plugins have been removed from the Steam Workshop by Keen and are now only accessible through other external means. Visit the [Plugins](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Plugins "Plugins") page for details.
