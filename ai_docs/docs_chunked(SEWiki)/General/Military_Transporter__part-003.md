The Military Transporter rivals the [Argentavis](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Argentavis_mk.1_2_no_factory "Argentavis mk.1 2 no factory") as the largest and most heavily armed NPC ship presently in Space Engineers. It's mass is double that of the Argentavis, because of its heavy armor. The Argentavis could be considered more dangerous due to its more active behavior. The Military Transporter mounts 2 [Gatling Turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gatling_Turret "Gatling Turret") on the forward facing, 1 Gatling on the rear, 1 [Missile Turret](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Missile_Turret "Missile Turret") and Gatling turret dorsally, 1 Gatling ventrally, and a Missile turret on port and starboard sides, as well as a belly Gatling turret. In addition to this, almost the entire hull is plated in heavy armor.

Approaching too close to the nose of the vessel, ~300 meters to its front, will set off its "Hostiles detected - Requesting Backup" signal. Soon after, a drone will fly in and gun down the engineers. Most of the time these drones will be [Incisor mk.1](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Incisor_mk.1 "Incisor mk.1") drones with a high +93.% chance of being an Incisor mk.1 (12/13 attempts). It should be noted that this vessel does have a chance to spawn the rare [Eradicator\_mk.1](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Eradicator_mk.1 "Eradicator mk.1"), one of the tougher drones in the game, and so far, a unique drone spawn for the Military Transport vessel. The space ship can only summon back-up with as long as its [SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") owned [Antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna") is functional and active.

The Gatlings will not open fire until you close within ~700m, the missiles within ~400m, as such, one strategy is to match speed and heading with the ship and pick off the point defenses from a safe distance. Another option is to eject junk materials towards the ship so that the turrets are distracted by your cloud of chaff, allowing you to park your ship in a blind spot on the hull, or move in closer for a better shot.

It's worth noting that the octagonal pods towards the aft of the ship obscure line of sight for the port and starboard missile turrets. In addition to the limited turrets at the rear of the ship, this makes approach from rear/ventral direction the safest approach.

In addition to this also being the safest approach, a quirk of engineering in the transporter's design also exposes a vulnerability here: At the rear of the vessel, inset from the rear engines is a small alcove in the hull, surrounded by interior walls. A single well placed missile into this alcove can destroy the ship's primary reactor, although it has a series of spare reactors.

### Ingress

The front of the ship has a large cargo door with space for personnel to slip in the gap, alternatively you can "pop" the armor block in the top corner to break the door off, allowing a small craft to enter through the hangar/cargo bay. Alternatively, there are visible pods on the sides of the ship, (after cutting through a protective catwalk barricade) which have doors entering into the ships corridors.

The ship has 2 seperate decks connected by stairwells at the fore, on both port and starboard side, as well as shafts port and starboard side, mid-ship. The upper floor provides access to the reactor at the aft of the ship, while the lower floor provides access to the bridge (aft), and cargo bay (fore). The stairwells at the front, the cargo bay, as well as the atrium outside the bridge are all protected by interior turrets; so you will need to kill the power, or bring an assault rifle to get past them.

### A sting in the tail...

Finally, don't forget this ship is also booby trapped, see the "trap" section at the bottom for precise location and ways to disable it. Attempting to engage the ships inertial dampers without taking proper precautions will cause it to detonate, likely destroying the bridge (as well as you and the cargo bay) in the process.
