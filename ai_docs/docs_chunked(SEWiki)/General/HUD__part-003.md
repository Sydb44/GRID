| GUI Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Inventory capacity bar (1) | This capacity bar indicates the percentage of inventory taken in the engineer's suit (but not the grid's inventory). Turns red when nearly full. Press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to access the inventory. |
| Toolbar (2) | The icons indicate tools or blocks that you can use by pressing number keys. Press [0 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to change to the engineer's empty hand (no tool active / no block to be placed). Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to use the [Tool Bar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") Configuration screen. |
| Toolbar selection (3) | Engineers have 9 [toolbars](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") at their disposal. Press [, key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and [. key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to cycle through toolbars, or use [CTRL+1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to [CTRL+9 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to go directly to a toolbar. |
| Mirror mode (4) | (In [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode"), [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") only:) A bright icon indicates [Symmetry](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") is on, dull indicates off. Toggle this mirroring mode by pressing [N key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). |
| Auto-rotation (5) | (In [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode") only:) A bright icon indicates block auto-rotation is on, dull indicates off. Toggle auto-rotation by pressing [T key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). |
| Grid size (6) | In [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode") only:) Indicates the grid size of the block you are holding. Press the toolbar slot's number again to toggle between small grid and large grid.  <br>In the sample screenshot, pressing [1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") would select a large-grid armor block, and pressing [1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") again would select a small-grid armor block. |
| Environment (7) | Shows the oxygen and temperature in the environment.<br><br>Oxygen can be either **None**, **Low**, or **High**. These affect if player can breathe with the helmet open and whether the [space suit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support#The_Space_Suit "Life Support") can refill itself.  <br>Temperature can be **Freeze**, **Cold**, **Warm**, **Hot**, or **Inferno**. These impact the suit power usage and the amount of damage taken when out of power.  <br>Both of these are affected by [enclosed cockpits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit"), [pressurized ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") and [planet weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather"). |
| Help button (8) | Press [F1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to watch in-app help videos and look up controls. |
| Gravity and horizon indicators (9) | Indicates the current [artificial gravity (A-gravity)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator") and [planetary gravity (P-gravity)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") in metres per second per second.  <br>The globe indicates the horizon of the engineer, and a cross indicates the current heading relative to this horizon when moving. In zero gravity, the circle shows no horizon. |

### Ship/Vehicle Information

[![Hud-ship.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/Hud-ship.png?9917d3)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Hud-ship.png)

| GUI Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Parking Brake / Handbrake (1) | The icon indicates whether the parking brake is on. Toggle the handbrake and the lock states of [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") or [Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") blocks by pressing [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Configure [Cockpit Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls") before using this to dock! |
| Broadcasting (2) | The icon indicates whether the ship is broadcasting a signal or listening only. Requires an [Antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna") block. Toggle ship broadcasting/listening by pressing [O key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). |
| Power (3) | The icon indicates whether batteries and power producing blocks are on or off. [Toggle this grid's power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls") on or off by pressing [Y key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). |
| Mass (4) | The number indicates the mass of the ship in kg, including cargo.  <br>Since SE v205 it's the physics engine mass therefore can be used to calculate how much thrust one needs. |
| Remaining power (5) | The number indicates the real-life time remaining before the grid runs out of power if you were to continue doing what you are doing right now. |
| Power usage percentage (6) | This bar indicates the percentage of available power currently being used. If it indicates medium to low values, your power production is good. If this bar is 100% full and turns red, the ship needs more power than available (and you need add e.g. more batteries). |
| Hydrogen percentage (7) | This bar indicates the percentage of Hydrogen available in the ship's tanks. If the bar is 100% full, then all tanks are full. Useful as fuel gauge for ships with Hydrogen Thrusters. Check whether the tanks are set to stockpile or provide hydrogen! |
