When encountered on planetary surfaces, the parachute will deploy and the cargo drop will slowly float down. When encountered in space or on moons, the canvas has not been used and can be looted.

It will always at least be built of the following parts:

*   At least 1 [Button Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Button_Panel "Button Panel"), possibly also dummy button panels
*   [Parachute Hatch](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Parachute_Hatch "Parachute Hatch") supplied with [Canvas](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Canvas "Canvas")
*   [Small Cargo Container](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Cargo_Container "Small Cargo Container") or [Medium Cargo Container](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medium_Cargo_Container "Medium Cargo Container")
*   [Small Battery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Battery "Small Battery")
*   [Antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna")

Some cargo drops also have thrusters, gyroscopes, and sensors. Their passive defensive abilities include the programming to run away from players. You will need to hunt these cargo drops down and disable them before you can interact with them -- and before they accidentally destroy themselves by crashing into things.

## Loot (Spoilers)

If you get to the cargo drop before the countdown ends, you gain some random loot.

*   Press the button for a lucky chance to win a Steam market tradable armor [skin](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Skins "Skins") for your suit or tools.
    *   There can be several buttons, active and inactive, and sometimes buttons also break if the drop crashlands too hard.
    *   Each player can only get three random skins per day, afterwards it will say you found nothing.
*   Open the cargo container to get some random [components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component"), [Engineer Plushie](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Engineer_Plushie "Engineer Plushie"), [Saberoid Plushie](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Saberoid_Plushie "Saberoid Plushie"), [space credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits"), or [tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool "Tool"). No Prototech to be found here.
*   Finally, grind down the whole thing to salvage its components.

Cargo drops keep spawning randomly during longer (Steam) play sessions, but Steam Marketplace loot drops are limited. If the lucky button repeatedly responds "You found nothing", try again 24 real-life hours later.

## Gameplay Considerations

On a multiplayer server, an Unknown Signal can be used as an implicit indicator of another player's presence, because we know they spawn near players. In a [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") start, Unknown signals are a valuable source of components, tools, space credits, and blocks.

There are strong unknown signals and standard unknown signals:

### Standard Unknown Signals

Standard unknown signals appear in singleplayer and multiplayer games. These cargo drops always appear within 1.5 to 4.5 kilometres of a player, basically in jetpacking distance.

Players are alerted to their own cargo drop with a green HUD signal if they have signals enabled on their [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"). From 80 metres away you can also hear a beeping sound when approaching.

Other players don't see your drop's green HUD signal, but can still steal your drop if they see the parachute, or come across it by chance — and possibly ambush you.

### Strong Unknown Signals

Strong unknown signals are a bit larger and appear only in multiplayer games, and only in space. They typically spawn far away from you, requiring space flight to reach them, because they spawn within 20 to 90 kilometres of any player. All players who have signals enabled on their [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") are alerted to these cargo drops with a strong HUD signal.

### Are they worth it?

You can always use cargo drops as a source of components or batteries, for example in early game, in emergencies, or in a [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") playthrough.

If you are already capable of space flight, is it worth flying to a **strong unknown signal**? Depends:

*   Cons: Their salvage value is low at that game stage.
*   Pros: Their main advantage is that their lucky button gives you rarer suit/tool skins. Mainly, they are a nice opportunity to meet the neighbours. ;-)

## Trivia

Unknown Signals used to be called Cargo Drops. In the game files, the standard and strong unknown signals are called PersonalContainer and CompetitiveContainer, respectively.
