    *   If you want to give tips on how to play the game, write a [tutorial](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tutorial "Tutorial").
*   This Wiki has been designed with game information and mechanics in mind. However, if you feel that an external guide or gameplay tip would be useful, please either:
    *   Link to the guide externally - for example, a guide to building an airlock on the [Air Vent](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Air_Vent "Air Vent") page. **Remember to credit the author**.
    *   Use the {{Spoiler}} template and place this information inside the spoiler tag.
*   Sources may include, but are not limited to: [The Space Engineers subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengineers/) , [Space Engineers Steam guides](https://steamcommunity.com/app/244850/guides/) , [Twitch clips or streams](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Space%20Engineers) or [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/).

## Categorization Rules

*   All Pages: Every page should be in a category. If a contributor does not know what category a page should go, it should remain uncategorized so that an admin can use the "uncategorized pages" tool to find it and place it in the appropriate category.
*   Lowest Relevant level only: do not place a page into all the categories in a nest. Only the lowest category that is appropriate is needed.
*   Max number of categories for a page (?): Do not place a page into lots of categories. If a page will fit into more than 3 categories, then it may need to be worked.
*   Creating a new category: In general, contributors should avoid making new categories. If a new category is appropriate, then the category page should be filled in with content. Categories should have more than 5 pages in them to be justified.
*   For more help with categories, see [Help:Category](http://community.wiki.gg/wiki/Help:Category)

## Templates

Templates are preformatted blocks of text and/or code that are used repeatedly or have small amounts of content that change often. They are generally placed at the top of a page, though that is not always the case.

### Common, General Wiki.gg Templates

*   [{{clr}}](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Clr "Template:Clr") - Clears a full line between the lowest pixel of content above the tag, and the highest pixel below the tag. Commonly used just before a new header while an image or floating table (i.g. table of contents) is placed in the previous.
*   [{{Stub}}](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Stub "Template:Stub") - This indicates that an article is to short to justify its own page. It either needs to be expanded or placed as part of another article.
*   [{{Delete|Reason}}](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Delete "Template:Delete") - See Below.
*   [{{Main|Page}}](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Main "Template:Main") - This is used to refer back to a page that explains a topic in more depth. Generally used in top level pages that give an over view of many game mechanics or content.

### Special Templates, Mostly Unique to this Site

*   [{{Cleanup|Reason}}](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Cleanup "Template:Cleanup") - Clean Up template is used to indicate that the article does not follow the styling guidelines and needs reworking.
*   [{{WIP}}](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:WIP "Template:WIP") - If an article is still under construction, placing the {{WIP}} tag on it will indicate that it is a Work In Progress and should not be deleted or taken as complete. This should only be used if there is a large amount of work to be done and will be worked on in the near future.

## Deletion

Reasons for deletion include, but are not limited to:

*   Copyright violations and other material violating the non-free content criteria.
*   Vandalism, including inflammatory redirects, pages that exist only to disparage their subject, patent nonsense, or gibberish
*   Advertising or other spam without relevant content (but not an article about an advertising-related subject).
*   Articles for which thorough attempts to find reliable sources to verify them have failed.
*   Redundant or otherwise useless templates.
*   Categories representing over-categorization.
*   Files that are unused, obsolete, or violate the Non-free policy.
*   Any other use of the article, template, project, or user namespace that is contrary to the established separate policy for that namespace.
*   Any other content not suitable for an encyclopedia.

subject to the condition that improvement or deletion of an offending section, if practical, is preferable to deletion of an entire page.

Since only Admins are able to delete the pages, regular users may mark the page for deleting by using the **{{delete}}** template.

## Power User Privileges

Admins, Staff, and some other contributors maintain the privilege to change or diverge from the styling guide lines at any time.

## Tutorials

Modding Tutorials and Scripting Tutorials use a template to help authors include all relevant information.
