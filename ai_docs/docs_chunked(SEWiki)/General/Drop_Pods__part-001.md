The legacy planetary variant has no wheels and no cockpit

The legacy moon variant has wheels and a cockpit

Drop pods exist in several variants:

*   The [Respawn Rover](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Respawn_Rover "Respawn Rover") is the current default since version 1.207.
*   The legacy [Drop Pod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pod "Drop Pod") was optimised for planetary landings.
*   The legacy [Moon Drop Pod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Moon_Drop_Pod "Moon Drop Pod") was a variant of the drop pod with a cockpit and [wheels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension "Wheel Suspension") to ease survival on moons with low gravity and no atmosphere.
*   The [Respawn Space Pod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Respawn_Space_Pod "Respawn Space Pod") is a variant for a space start.

Most usage tips on this page apply to all of them equally.

## Survival equipment

Drop pods are [small-grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid") [vessels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Built_Ship "Pre-Built Ship") that provide the basic requirements to survive:

*   They contain a [Survival kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_kit "Survival kit") to recharge health and to produce basic ingots and basic spare parts from stone.
*   The [Respawn Space Pod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Respawn_Space_Pod "Respawn Space Pod") contains a [Survival kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_kit "Survival kit") and [O2 H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") to recharge oxygen, hydrogen.
*   They typically have a cockpit with inventory.
*   For planetary emergency landings, it is equipped with a [Parachute Hatch](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Parachute_Hatch "Parachute Hatch") set to auto-deploy.
*   It provides enough energy in its [Battery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery") to give you time to find a good place to start, but you canâ€™t rely on it for an extended time.
*   It has an antenna that helps you find it again.
*   It comes with an ore detector.

The passenger seat contains in its inventory an [S-10 Pistol](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/S-10_Pistol "S-10 Pistol"), four [S-10 Magazines](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/S-10_Magazine "S-10 Magazine"). If [Economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") is enabled it also contains a [Datapad](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Datapad "Datapad") with coordinates of one of the nearby [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"). If [Food](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food") is enabled, it also contains some emergency meals. Press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") while sitting in the seat to access its inventory.

## Usage

The pod provides early-game life support, a respawn point, and spare parts production. Your task is to use its unique features, and to strategically disassemble it while you hand-mine and build your first starter base and respawn point.

Tip: For a planetary landing, you will start in mid-air, seated in the drop pod, which auto-deploys its parachutes while safely descending. Stay seated (possibly switch to third person by pressing [V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and use the drop time to look around and survey the landscape in third-person view.

### How to find the next trade station

If [Economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") is enabled, a datapad in your seat will have the GPS of a [trading station](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") written in it.

To add the Trade Station GPS to your HUD:

1.  Press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") while sitting in the seat to access its inventory.
2.  Drag the datapad to your inventory.
3.  [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-clicking the Datapad in the [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") screen to open it.
4.  Press the "Create GPS Marker" button.
5.  Press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the Datapad, and in the [terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal"), switch from the Inventory tab to the GPS tab.
6.  Find a new greyed out GPS for the station in the GPS list.
7.  Enable the signal by double-clicking the GPS, or by selecting it and ticking the "Show on HUD" box.

Now when you close the terminal and look around the world, you should be able to see the signal for the station on your HUD.

## How to prevent auto-deletion of a drop pod

In multiplayer, the pod is temporary and disappears after you log out, or after you die and respawn in a new pod! An Admin can configure the pod's despawn behaviour in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

In singleplayer, the pod does not despawn unless you spawn a new one (e.g. by turning off your survival kit so you do not have a respawn point and dying).
