# Learning to Survive Scenario - Official Space Engineers Wiki

In this [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") you restore an asteroid outpost to act as your base of operations, and explore the remains of what a once thriving industry left behind. Learn about space engineering, and finally, prove yourself in a boss battle, this is where your career begins!

Your chance to be promoted to engineer

You can gain up to four [Steam Achievements](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Steam_Achievements "Steam Achievements") for completing it, and the achievements will also appear as a [badge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC_and_Achievement_Icons "DLC and Achievement Icons") on your game start screen. This scenario was created by Keen Software House.

## Should I play it?

This is typically the second scenario that beginners _start_ -- at the same time, it’s not the second scenario that players _complete_.

This long, in-depth scenario gives you the opportunity to show everything that you've learned in the [The First Jump Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_First_Jump_Scenario "The First Jump Scenario"). It asks you to solve a series of engineering tasks of varying difficulty, and it gives even beginners a lot of opportunity to learn, experiment, and build.

A beginner can aim to obtain the first [Steam Achievement](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Steam_Achievements "Steam Achievements") by completing all obvious tasks at the highlighted locations. The final objective is rather advanced, requiring preparation and creativity: You not only repair pre-built spaceships and bases, but have to build your own solutions.

Many players post-pone the advanced achievements and play some [Sandbox Games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game") first.

## Spoiler Free Overview

You can complete the tasks in any order and with no time limit. It’s recommended to leave yourself [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") markers as reminders of incomplete tasks.

Even though it looks like a tutorial, this scenario is a full survival game with Autorespawn and Autosave on, so always make sure that you have a respawn point (Survival Kit or Med Room) close by — otherwise you’ll need another ship to fly back to your ship.

Inventory size, grind speed, and weld speed have a favourable multiplier, jetpacks are allowed, and [progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is switched off. You may have Random Encounters with passive NPCs (if you prefer piracy), but there will be no [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"). You will be able to explore asteroids, the Earthlike Planet, and the Moon, but the planet will have no [weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather").

You can continue playing in this world after completing all tasks, there is no timer nor limitations. You can even change the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") and add mods or more planets later.

## Steam Achievements (minor spoilers)

Completing the engineering tasks unlocks the final objective (boss battle) with an opportunity to complete three more Steam achievements. The scenario will give you a clear hint about the final objective to gain the second Steam achievement. The third and fourth achievements are awarded for “excellent execution” of the second. You will have to replay the scenario if you've missed the last two achievements.

1.  Engineering Degree - Finish all tasks of the Learning to Survive Scenario. The tasks are marked with beacons.
2.  Promoted Engineer - Complete the final objective of the Learning to Survive Scenario. After completing all scenario tasks (that means, you have completed the "Engineering Degree" achievement), you'll get the necessary instructions for the final objective automatically.
3.  It Takes But One - Complete all scenario objectives without dying.
4.  Planetesphobia - Disable the final scenario objective without entering the atmosphere.

## Locations (minor spoilers)

3D overview of locations in the Learning to Survive scenario (top-down view when standing on first platform)

New task locations are revealed as you progress. It is possible to be out of broadcasting range of further away task markers. If you have the impression you missed a task, first return to the central platform and try retracing your steps to find the marker again.

If you still need help to find a task location, copy the respective GPS line (or even the whole list) into your clipboard. In game, open the [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") screen and click **Paste from Clipboard**. Then double-click the grey GPS entry to save it to the list and make it visible on your HUD!

Note: If it takes too long to reach certain locations, make sure you make use of what you have learned at the Jump Drive task.
