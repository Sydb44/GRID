7.  Enable the signal by double-clicking the GPS, or by selecting it and ticking the "Show on HUD" box.

Now when you close the terminal and look around the world, you should be able to see the signal for the station on your HUD.

## How to prevent auto-deletion of a drop pod

In multiplayer, the pod is temporary and disappears after you log out, or after you die and respawn in a new pod! An Admin can configure the pod's despawn behaviour in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

In singleplayer, the pod does not despawn unless you spawn a new one (e.g. by turning off your survival kit so you do not have a respawn point and dying).

## How to enable respawn pods

To spawn with a drop pod, the host must enable respawn ships in the advanced [world settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings#Enable_respawn_ships "World Settings") for everyone.

Especially for players wanting to start in a drop pod on a custom star system with [manually spawned-in planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/How_to_Spawn_Planets_and_Moons_Manually "How to Spawn Planets and Moons Manually"), make sure to have Respawn Ships enabled in the advanced settings. Then load and save the world, exit, reload, and force respawn. After this, the drop pod spawn should be an option on these non-standard planets as well.

### How to insert your own Respawn Ship

This [Respawn Ship Steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=311423213&s) will show you how to create and publish your own Respawn Ship mod from start to finish.

## Trivia

The first drop pods, including the [Respawn Space Pod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Respawn_Space_Pod "Respawn Space Pod"), have been introduced in the major Space Engineers Release of February 28, 2019 that brought the game out of Early Access.

Judging by the blue colour scheme, the first emergency pods are possibly produced by the [Sol Cooperative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative") faction.
