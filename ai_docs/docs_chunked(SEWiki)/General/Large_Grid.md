# Large Grid - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![Blue Ship.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/8/89/Blue_Ship.png/320px-Blue_Ship.png?4a2f19)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Blue_Ship.png)

Space Engineers [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") can be mobile [Small Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid"), mobile Large Grids, or (large) [Stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Station "Station").

**Mobile Large Grids** are typically ships used for interplanetary travel or for fighting against other large-grid ships. Other examples of Large Grids include wheeled mobile bases, atmospheric haulers, interplanetary explorers, mobile mining platforms, battleships, shuttles, motherships with hangars and docking platforms, and so on.

Mobile large grids are typically started by dropping a large  [![Icon Block Landing Gear.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/2/2d/Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png/21px-Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png?d381be)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") and building on it.

Large grids are built out of large-grid blocks. Note that some functional and decorative blocks are only available in large-grid size and some are not available as large-grid blocks. Assign the block to the [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") and press the number of the slot again to toggle between large and small size variant, if available. When attempting to add a new block to a large grid, the large-grid version is automatically selected. If a block does not have a large-grid version, you can’t add it.

Tip: Read the [Rotor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") article to learn an advanced trick how to add small grid blocks to a large grid.

## Comparison

*   **Large Grids** are made of [Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blocks "Blocks") 125 times larger than the volume of [Small Grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid") blocks. This means you need 5x5x5 small cubes to fill one large cube. This does not, however, mean that the mass and costs are increased by 125 times, since large grids blocks are “hollow”, so to speak.

*   The static variant of a large grid are [stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Station "Station") (see there).

## Is this block large grid or small grid?

Look at the icons in the top right of the block tooltip to distinguish large and small grid blocks.
