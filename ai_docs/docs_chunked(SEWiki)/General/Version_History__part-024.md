### Version [1.182.0](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Version/1.182.0 "Version/1.182.0") Minor

[Reference](https://forum.keenswh.com/threads/update-1-183-2-beta-improvements.7396955/)

Release Date: 31 August 2017

**Introduction:**

Hello, Engineers! While we are fully focused on next major update, in this week's minor we are bringing bunch of fixes likes not spawning containers, small advance rotor head clipping through rotor body. This update is bringing a lot of crash fixes with various UI cases, resource distribution, copy and pasting of drones in MP and others. Perhaps the most noteworthy fix this update is concerning the visual bug for moving grids that was encountered by RYZEN and I7 users.

Unfortunately there is no video for this week (greetings to Xoc).

While we have no pun to end on this week, from Xoc, and I (I23I7) am not good at puns. Let us end on one of my favorite quotes:

„Well, the thing about a black hole - it's main distinguishing feature - is it's black. And the thing about space, the color of space, your basic space color - is it's black. So how are you supposed to see them?“ - Holly
