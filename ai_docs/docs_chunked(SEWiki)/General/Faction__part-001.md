# Factions - Official Space Engineers Wiki

There are [NPC factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions") and Player factions.

*   In [multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") games, factions help organize players into cooperative groups, where only a select group of people can use shared grids.
*   In singleplayer games, factions are only relevant when interacting with NPCs.

You access the **Factions** tab by accessing the Terminal (press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Here you can create a new player faction, join an existing one, read faction descriptions and member lists, and check your standing.

*   Faction membership carries with it a reputation which defines relationships with other players or NPCs as **hostile**, **neutral**, or **friendly**.
*   If there are [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU") limits imposed, they are typically split among factions and their members.

## How to Found a Faction?

Each player can found a faction. If applicable, leave your current faction first, because you can only found a faction if you are not a member of one. Press K and go to the Factions tab and click **Create** to start a new faction. You become its founder and first member.

First, choose a **Faction Tag** and **Faction Name**. The Faction Tag is automatically added to the front of all members' names and faction-owned beacons.

*   A player faction tag must be three characters long; the faction name must be four or more characters long. (Characters may include letters, punctuation, numbers, but no spaces)
*   Note that [NPC factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions") have _four_\-letter tags, which you can see for example in the names of all [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts").

Next, click the **Edit** button, and then click the **Eye** button in the corner of the **faction logo**. Here you choose a cool logo and set your team color (foreground and background). There are mods and DLCs that add more logos as well.

Optionally, provide a public and a private description:

*   The **Public Description** is visible to other players on the **Factions** tab, regardless of reputation; use it to tell others, for example, whether your members are interested in PvP, which languages you speak, if you are accepting new members and which skills you are looking for, which territory you claim, and so on.
*   Fill in the **Private Description** to welcome new members, explain your faction's _secret_ goals and rules, command hierarchy, and so on.

The Founder can choose to set the faction to **Accept Anyone**.

*   Allowing everyone to join can make sense if the game's online mode is set to Friends or Private.
*   If you are playing on a Public server, auto-accepting everyone is however not recommended, because griefers could join your faction too easily and destroy your bases from the inside.

The Founder can choose to set the faction to **Accept Peace** in order to automatically accept peace proposals by other factions.

*   Similar to _Accept Anyone_, accepting peace makes sense when playing with friends, but leaves you defenseless against griefers on public servers.

The **Add NPC** button adds virtual members to the faction. This does not literally add NPC avatars to the game. It is used in scenarios so that a faction does not cease to exist after the last player leaves. NPC factions also have virtual Founder NPCs added named "<Faction Name> CEO".

## How to Join a Faction?

When joining a multiplayer server or in singleplayer, you are at first factionless. To share access to grids, you can joing a faction. On the **Join** screen, every player can either found a new faction, choose no faction, or join an existing one. Players can ask to join any faction, but must be accepted by a leader or founder before they actually become a member.

To apply to become a faction member in a running game, do the following:

1.  Press K and go to the Factions tab.
2.  If applicable, leave your current faction first, because you can only join a faction if you are not a member of one.
3.  Select a faction from the list, and click **Join**.
4.  Negotiate in chat and wait for the Leaders to accept your application before approaching their turrets.

After you've been accepted, you can share blocks and grids which you [own](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership"), and use shared grids from other members.

## What Can Faction Ranks Do?

There are 3 ranks of membership in factions.

*   **Members** can interact with faction-shared blocks, and are not targeted by faction weapons. Most players will have this rank.
*   **Leaders** can do everything a member can, plus invite new members, confirm new members, and kick existing members. Only very few are given this rank by the Founder.
*   **Founders** can do everything a member and leader can do, plus promote trusted members to Leader; demote members to lose Leader status; and make or cancel peace treaties with other factions. There can only be one founder per faction.

If the founder leaves, then the faction has no founder and the remaining players should start a new faction with a new founder.

## How to Promote/Demote Members?

As the Founder or Leader, you will see new membership applications in the members list of the **Factions** tab. Members will possibly also contact you with requests to change their permissions here.

Founders or Leaders can:

*   To turn an Applicant into a Members, select the player name and click **Accept**.
*   To turn a Member into a Leader, select the member name and click **Promote**.
*   To turn a Leader into a Member, select the member name and click **Demote**.
*   To unlock buildable block recipes for a player, select the member name and click **Share Progress**. (Only if [Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"))
