# How to use respawn points strategically

Respawn points are [Survival Kits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit") and [Medical Rooms](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room"). You can build several respawn points and share them with your faction.

## Make backups

Build multiple respawn points as backups, in bases or on vehicles.

*   In multiplayer, if cooperating players enable **Shared with: Faction** on their respawn points, faction members will auto-respawn at the closest respawn point.
*   If Auto-Respawn is off in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), faction members can choose where to respawn among their factionâ€™s "ready" respawn points.

## STRATEGIES

Use respawn points strategically when fighting players (PvP) or computer controlled drones (PvE).

*   During an attack, maintain at least one respawn point at a close, safe, strategic location.
*   Sometimes you also need to deactivate respawn points strategically, if they were compromised/trapped or the battle has moved away from their location.
*   In PvP, trap or grind down enemy players' respawn points to prevent them from respawning.
*   In PvP, if you grind and re-weld the other faction's respawn points, you take them over for your faction ([Hacking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking")).

## Fast travel

You can use respawn points to "teleport"/fast-travel without inventory, even if Auto-Respawn is enabled:

1.  Manually switch off the closest Auto-Respawn point.
2.  Build a [Timer Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") and set it to switch the respawn point back on after 1 minute.
3.  Empty your inventory into a cargo container.
4.  Press [BACKSPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to respawn at the (now) second closest respawn point.
