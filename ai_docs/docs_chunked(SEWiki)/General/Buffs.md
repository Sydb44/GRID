Survival buffs are benefits for the [engineer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer") that give you higher stats, affecting speed and health. They are an optional part of [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") from version 1.207 on. You can enable or disable them in the game settings under **Advanced > Survival > Survival Buffs**.

Press [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[B key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to see your buff levels.

## Buffed Stats

Surviving improves the following stats over five levels:

*   Maximum Health 100 to 150: +10 per level
*   Welding Speed 100% to 150%: +10% per level
*   Grinding Speed 100% to 150%: +10% per level
*   Movement Speed 100% to 120%: +4% per level
*   Oxygen Consumption 100% to 50%: -10% per level (lower is better)

Your character's welding and grinding buffs combine with the bonuses from upgraded [welders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_\(Tool\) "Welder (Tool)") and [grinders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_\(tool\) "Grinder (tool)") that you are using to reach the maximum bonus.

## How to get buffs

For every 45 minutes you stay alive, you gain an extra buff level, up to five levels for each stat. You can gain maximum stats by staying alive for about 4 in-game days.

## How to get debuffs

If you [die](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death"), all survival buffs are reset back to 100% and you have to regain them.

If **Reduced Stats on Respawn** is enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), your current stats are weakened.

Debuffs are intended to discourage players from repeatedly dying and respawning to regain health quickly in battle, instead of using drones or strategies.

When your [food](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food") bar falls below 20%, you experience temporary debuffs:

*   You walk more slowly
*   You can no longer sprint

When your food bar is zero:

*   You continuously start taking health damage until you die or eat something to stop the damage.
