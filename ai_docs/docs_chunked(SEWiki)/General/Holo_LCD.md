The Holo LCD is a decorative block that acts as a small holographic 2D projector. You can build it only if you have purchased the [Decorative Pack 3](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack_3 "Decorative Pack 3") DLC, but the owner can share its usage with anyone. For alternative DLC-free display blocks, see [LCD Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Panels "LCD Panels").

## Usage

When it is switched off, it's just a narrow bar. When it is switched on, but has no content loaded, it displays a floating flat square of grey static noise below the bar. Any selected text, image, or script appears to float a bit in front of the bar and visually covers the width and height of a block face.

Players can walk, rovers drive, and ships fly through the lower seven eighth of the holographic display. It works well, for example, as an unobtrusive runway marker or as a cool pop-up cockpit screen.

For LCD configuration and usage, see [LCD Surface Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/LCD_Surface_Options "LCD Surface Options").

## Construction

The special thing about the Holo LCD is that its display area is non-solid. It exists for large and small grid and requires 20 W power. It's physical shape is thin and oblong and it has only two mount points, similar to [Corner LCDs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Corner_LCD "Corner LCD"). You can build it on large and small grids.
