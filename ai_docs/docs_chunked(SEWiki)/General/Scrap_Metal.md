drops from damaged blocks

**Scrap Metal** is a low-value item. Usually you can [salvage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder "Grinder") all components from blocks, but if blocks were damaged, scraps drop in place of components. Scrap metal serves no direct purpose other than being a warning sign of destroyed blocks: Its presence indicates that you have just lost some valuable components.

## Usage

[![Item scrap metal.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Item_scrap_metal.png/320px-Item_scrap_metal.png?ba35ab)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Item_scrap_metal.png)

### How to "obtain" Scrap Metal

The following events or actions result in dropped components being turned into scrap, and should be avoided:

*   [Damaging or destroying](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics "Damage Mechanics") blocks using [weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapon "Weapon"), collisions, or [drills](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drill "Drill") can drop scrap metal to the ground or into space
*   Welding damaged blocks using the [Welder](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_\(Tool\) "Welder (Tool)") or the ship-mounted [Welder](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_\(Block\) "Welder (Block)").  
    This can fill up your inventory with scrap when you don't expect it.
*   Destroying or grinding [Batteries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery") puts scrap into your inventory drop instead of  [![Icon Item Power Cell.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Power_Cell.png/21px-Icon_Item_Power_Cell.png?29ae8b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power_Cell "Power Cell") [Power Cell](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power_Cell "Power Cell")s
*   Light and Heavy Armor blocks destroyed by a [weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") or [drills](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drill "Drill") contain/drop Scrap Metal upon their destruction no matter the stage of construction. Only the amount of scrap dropped depends on the amount of steel plates still welded into the block.

**Note:** Power Cells are turned into scrap because Batteries start out with a small amount of free charge, and if there would be no cost to destroying and placing Batteries, you could get free energy out of continually grinding down and rewelding batteries. The power cells in other blocks (Hydrogen Engine etc.) do not turn to scrap when grinding them, as these blocks do not store any free charge!

### How to recyle it

Scrap metal can be refined in a [Basic Refinery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Basic_Refinery "Basic Refinery") or [Refinery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery") to get some of the destroyed metal back. A basic refinery produces 0.56  [![Icon Item Iron Ingot.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Iron_Ingot.png/21px-Icon_Item_Iron_Ingot.png?388ec0)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") [Iron Ingots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") per 1 Scrap Metal, while a refinery produces 0.8 iron ingots, or 1.6 with four  [![Icon Block Yield Module.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Yield_Module.png/21px-Icon_Block_Yield_Module.png?8f14e7)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Yield_Module "Yield Module") [Yield Modules](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Yield_Module "Yield Module").

### How to pick it up

If your scrap metal is floating in space, suck it into an inventory using a  [![Icon Block Collector.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Collector.png/21px-Icon_Block_Collector.png?e28170)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector") [Collector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector").

You can also pick the pieces up into your personal inventory by pressing [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") (or [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click while not holding a tool), from where you can manually transfer it into a refinery or another block with inventory space, such as a [Cargo Container](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cargo_Container "Cargo Container").

### How to detect damage with sensors

[Sensors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor") can be set up to detect floating items — including Scrap Metal. Outside of active mining operations and battle fields, no items should be floating, so you can use the presence of floating scrap as a damage indicator:

1.  Set up sensors with ranges covering individual sections of your ship or base.
2.  Name them after the section they watch, so you can tell them apart.
3.  Set up the sensor to toggle an orange light in sections where floating items are detected.  
    The light warns working crew of local hull damage and helps repair crew identify sections in need of repair.

Triggering more advanced emergency responses (such as dispatching autonomous repair drones, activating welders, playing siren sounds and automatically decompressing the area to preserve oxygen, displaying warning text or images on LCD displays, ...) is possible using [AI blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence"), [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block"), or [Event Controllers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Event_Controller "Event Controller"). batteries. The power cell in a Hydrogen Engine does not turn to scrap, as the engine is not created with any stored free charge.
