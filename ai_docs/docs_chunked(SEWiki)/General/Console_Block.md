The Console Block is a holographic table. To build it, you need to purchase the [Decorative Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack "Decorative Pack") DLC. If a purchaser of the DLC has built this block in multiplayer, other players can see the hologram and can be allowed to use the block, even if they cannot build it.

To save [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU") in a projector, unload the blueprint from this block before making a blueprint of the grid this block is on.

## Usage

The Console Block looks good as a sci-fi war room desk with a translucent hologram in the center.

_Any shape that you build_ and save as blueprint can be projected as hologram. The projection doesn't have to be a warship, it could also be a self-designed floor plan, a planetary terrain map, a solar system overview, a mecha construction diagram, the floating face of the ship AI, any pixelart that you can build...!

1.  Open the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") of the Console Block.
2.  Choose the hologram to be displayed from your list of [blueprints](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint").
3.  Move the projection in order to make it look aesthetically pleasing. The positioning buttons for the hologram work the same way as the ones in the [Projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") block.

What distinguishes the Console Block from the [Projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") is that the Console projection cannot be welded, it’s purely decorative and non-physical. In contrast to the large-grid Projector, you can use the large-grid console to project both large- and small-grid blueprints. Lastly, the Projector always projects blueprints in full 1:1 size, whereas the Console Block always scales them down so that a whole object fits.

## Construction

This block exists for large grid only. It takes up 1x1x1 blocks of space, but players can stand on top of it.
