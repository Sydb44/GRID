The  [![Icon Block Welder Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/4/41/Icon_Block_Welder_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Welder_Block.png?2e0da4)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_Block "Welder Block") Welder Block is a massive, ship-sized version of the handheld [Welder](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder "Welder") tool used when [Building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") blocks. It can be placed on both large and small ships, as well as stations.

Welders are essential in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"). Welder and [Grinder Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_Block "Grinder Block") are often used together on Constructor ships and [RC](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") repair drones. Welders are also an essential component of [3D Printers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer").

## Usage

To use the Welder, either turn it on manually in the [control panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"), or assign its in/off action to a slot in your [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar").

When it is turned on and in close proximity to an incomplete block, the Welder will first attempt to add components from its inventory to the construction stockpile, and then weld the block up, exactly as a handheld  [![Icon Item Welder.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/9/99/Icon_Item_Welder.png/21px-Icon_Item_Welder.png?9bba1d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder "Welder") [Welder (Tool)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder "Welder") would.

### How to weld safely

An active welder tip is lethal to players in the area of effect! Operational Space Health Agencies advise adding a [Sensor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor") configured to detect the presence of players that automatically deactivates the Welder.

### Requirements

For the Welder to work, the components needed for construction progress must be either in the target block's stockpile or in the Welder's inventory.

It's recommended to connect the Welder to a [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") with full cargo containers, then it will pull components from there. The Welder does not, however, automatically "order" missing components from the Build Planner, providing enough, or queuing up components is the engineer's job.

### Maintain block ownership in multiplayer

A welded functional block will be owned by the player who owns the welder block. This can cause ownership confusion when cooperating engineers use their Constructor ship/Welder Wall/3D Printer to assist another engineer to build their ship.

In this case, enable the **Help Others** setting to maintain the other player's ownership.

### How to withdraw and deposit components quickly

Build Planner buttons in Inventory Screen

The Welder gives your engineer access to the [Build Planner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Build_Planner "Build Planner") while you're seated in a cockpit:

1.  [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click unwelded blocks with the Welder from the cockpit to add the missing components to the Build Planner queue.
2.  Connect to the base and open the [Inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") screen.
3.  Filter the left side to show the welder inventory.
4.  Filter the right side to show the base's component containers.
5.  Click the **Withdraw** button to load the Welder with just the right components.

If you use the Build Planner later to withdraw components for something else, and some components are still in the Welder's internal inventory, then the Welder Block will not release them. So remember to empty the Welder manually after you're done.

To empty the Welder's inventory:

1.  Connect to the base and open the [Inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") screen.
2.  Filter the left side to show the welder inventory.
3.  Filter the right side to show component containers.
4.  Press the **Deposit All** button.

### How to build and repair fast and in bulk

Several conveyored Welders with overlapping areas of effect are called Welder Wall or Welder Pit. For example, fly small ships with self-[Projectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") slowly past the welders to repair them quickly.

Also look into [3D Printers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer") for grid mass-production.
