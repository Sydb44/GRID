Toggle your jetpack/magboots on and off by pressing [X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). |
| Broadcasting (3) | A bright [signal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal") icon indicates you are broadcasting, dull indicates listening-only. Toggle your suit's signal broadcasting on and off by pressing [O key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). |
| Light (4) | A bright icon indicates your helmet spotlights are on, dull indicates off. Toggle the suit's lights on and off by pressing [L key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). |
| Engineer Health (5) | The bar shows the percentage of engineer's health. |
| Engineer nutrition (6) | The bar shows the percentage of engineer's health. |
| Suit energy (7) | The bar shows the percentage of remaining energy of the suit. If it is depleted, the engineer will start losing health in extreme environments. |
| Oxygen (8) | The bar shows the percentage of oxygen remaining in the suit reservoir. The small bottle icons indicate the number of oxygen bottles in the player's inventory (but not how full they are). |
| Hydrogen (9) | The bar shows the percentage of hydrogen remaining in the suit. The small bottle icons indicate the number of hydrogen bottles in the player's inventory (but not how full they are). |
| Velocity (10) | This speed dial shows how fast you are moving in m/s. |

### Toolbar

[![HUD part - toolbar.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/HUD_part_-_toolbar.png/320px-HUD_part_-_toolbar.png?a5417f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:HUD_part_-_toolbar.png)

| GUI Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Inventory capacity bar (1) | This capacity bar indicates the percentage of inventory taken in the engineer's suit (but not the grid's inventory). Turns red when nearly full. Press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to access the inventory. |
| Toolbar (2) | The icons indicate tools or blocks that you can use by pressing number keys. Press [0 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to change to the engineer's empty hand (no tool active / no block to be placed). Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to use the [Tool Bar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") Configuration screen. |
| Toolbar selection (3) | Engineers have 9 [toolbars](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") at their disposal. Press [, key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and [. key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to cycle through toolbars, or use [CTRL+1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to [CTRL+9 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to go directly to a toolbar. |
| Mirror mode (4) | (In [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode"), [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") only:) A bright icon indicates [Symmetry](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") is on, dull indicates off. Toggle this mirroring mode by pressing [N key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). |
| Auto-rotation (5) | (In [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode") only:) A bright icon indicates block auto-rotation is on, dull indicates off. Toggle auto-rotation by pressing [T key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). |
| Grid size (6) | In [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode") only:) Indicates the grid size of the block you are holding. Press the toolbar slot's number again to toggle between small grid and large grid.  <br>In the sample screenshot, pressing [1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") would select a large-grid armor block, and pressing [1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") again would select a small-grid armor block. |
| Environment (7) | Shows the oxygen and temperature in the environment.<br><br>Oxygen can be either **None**, **Low**, or **High**. These affect if player can breathe with the helmet open and whether the [space suit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support#The_Space_Suit "Life Support") can refill itself.  <br>Temperature can be **Freeze**, **Cold**, **Warm**, **Hot**, or **Inferno**. These impact the suit power usage and the amount of damage taken when out of power.  <br>Both of these are affected by [enclosed cockpits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit"), [pressurized ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") and [planet weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather"). |
| Help button (8) | Press [F1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to watch in-app help videos and look up controls. |
| Gravity and horizon indicators (9) | Indicates the current [artificial gravity (A-gravity)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator") and [planetary gravity (P-gravity)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") in metres per second per second.  <br>The globe indicates the horizon of the engineer, and a cross indicates the current heading relative to this horizon when moving. In zero gravity, the circle shows no horizon. |
