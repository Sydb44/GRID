1.  Don't harvest it yet!
2.  Close the window and return after the amount of time shown under Growth Time.
3.  If you left the dialog open, click Refresh to see new progress.

If Growth Progress is 100% but Crop Health is below 100%:

*   You can harvest it and receive a partial yield.

If the Water Level is not 100%:

*   Fill ice in the Irrigation System to save your crops before their health drops to zero!
*   Make sure a O2/H2 Generator doesn't pull all the ice, e.g. by using separate inventories or sorters.
*   Crops die when the water level is zero. No seed or harvest can be recovered then.

## How long is the growth time?

Growth time and water usage:

Mushrooms: 12 mins, 12 L/min

Vegetables: 20 mins, 15 L/min

Grain: 30 min, 16 L/min

Fruit: 35 min, 20 L/min

## Can crops die?

Yes, crop health can decrease to zero. Crops in Farm Plots can die if it's exposed to extreme weather or vacuum, or if the plot runs out of water. A dead plant will look either scrawny brittle or composty darkbrown. The dialog will say in red "Cause of death" and a reason. If a crop died, no harvest or seed remain. The crop and seed also disappears if the farm plot gets destroyed.

## Can I cancel a farm plot?

You cannot take seeds out of the farm plot, they are not stored in any inventory after planting.

To free up a crop plot, you can click the plot and click Harvest on unripe plants (Growth Progress < 100%), but be aware that will destroy the plant and seed.

## Can I automate farming?

Yes, build a harvester using a [Collector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector"). Farm Plots are considered tanks and you can monitor their fill% in an event controller.

Planting cannot be automated.
