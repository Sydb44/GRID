## What is my PCU Limit?

By default, the max PCU is 100,000 on all platforms. In [experimental mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode") it's 200,000[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) on consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox) in Singleplayer, and it can be up to 500,000 on PC and PlayStation 5. The maximum safe PCU value in experimental mode on Xbox is 400,000 (Xbox Series X) and 150,000 (other Xbox variants).

On multiplayer servers, it could be set lower by its admin, e.g. 20,000 to prevent players from straining the server.

## How can I increase my PCU Limit?

If you pay for your own dedicated server, you can choose to remove the PCU limit for your game in [experimental mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode").

*   Singleplayer: You set or disable the limits of your worlds in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") under Block Limits before starting the game.
*   Multiplayer (Admin): Admins set global limits for everyone in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") before starting the game. Admins can also give themselves the ability to build without Block Limits on the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") in-game.
*   Multiplayer (Player): Players can [trade PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Trading "Player Trading") with other players on the same server. PCU is an extremely valuable second currency and worth more than [Space credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits"): Consider that trading PCU means the seller can build and own fewer grids, and the buyer can build and own more. If you sell your PCU, you limit your ability to play.
