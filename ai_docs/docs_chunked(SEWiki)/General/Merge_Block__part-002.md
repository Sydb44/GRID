*   Both grids must be of the same size: either small+small or large+large
*   You must have control over at least one of the grids: Either it must be flyable, or you need a utility ship (tug) with magnetic landing gear that can lift the grid into position.
*   You need [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") or faction permissions for both grids, for example by [hacking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking"), or by transferring both grids to "nobody".
*   The two grids to be merged cannot be sibling subgrids connected by only one [rotor, or piston, or hinge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks"). For example, “grid with merge block - piston - subgrid with merge block” won’t merge. Merging sometimes works when there are levels of indirection and the Merge Blocks are more than one subgrid (e.g. double hinges) apart.
*   If you merge a mobile grid to a static grid, the mobile grid will become static. [Turn the static grid into a "ship" first](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen") if you want to stay mobile.
*   You cannot merge captured NPC grids that are unclaimed. See [Claim NPC Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Claim_NPC_Ship "Claim NPC Ship").

### Will it merge permanently or temporarily?

Mastery of the Merge Block is a bit more complicated. If any full block surfaces of the two different grids (other than the merge blocks) touch, use of the merge blocks will _permanently_ bind the grids as one. Even switching off, or grinding off the Merge Blocks will not decouple such merged grids. When repairing a split-in-half ship, such permanent merging is done intentionally.

However, if you make sure that the two separate grids touch each other only with the Merge Blocks, and otherwise at most with thin or pointy edges of blocks (Slopes, Blast Door blocks, or similar), then the two grids can couple and decouple an infinite number of times. When building modular ships or [PBW](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Built_Weapons "Player Built Weapons")/torpedoes, such temporary merging is done intentionally.

### How to merge

How to fix a broken ship using two merge blocks

1.  Add one merge block to each ship/station. Make sure the clamp sides of the blocks face each other in their intended final positions.
2.  Switch both blocks on and confirm that they light up white.
3.  Push or fly the grids close together.
4.  When the Merge blocks clamps are less than one meter from each other, the blocks light up yellow and become magnetic if powered.
5.  When the Merge block faces are within less than ~0.1 meter, the grids snap and align themselves.
6.  After they merge, the blocks light up green.

The grids that are attached to each other are now treated as one grid. The merging allows power and control to pass through the blocks.

If a ship merges with a station, the mobile ship blocks will [convert](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen") to static station blocks.

If you want to merge the halves permanently, grind the Merge Blocks off afterwards.

### How to unmerge

After switching the Merge blocks off, the grids can become two separate grids again. The requirement for unmerging is that only the two Merge blocks (and beyond that, only blocks with thin/pointy edges) touch.

To unmerge, turn off the Merge blocks from the [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"). When you switch one Merge Block off, it releases the other and they lose their magnetic properties.

Warning: Unmerging does not restore the name of the merged smaller grid.

If you are separating a large-grid ship from a station, the next step is to revert the ship-to-station conversion through the [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen").

If any blocks got merged unintentionally, you’ll have to grind these blocks apart.

## Construction

The Merge Block occupies a 1x1x1 LG sized block space on large grids and stations, or a 1x3x3 SG block space on small grids. From version 1.199 on, a compact 1x1x1 [Small Merge Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Merge_Block "Small Merge Block") is also available.

The Block has mount points on 5 of 6 faces. Only the side with the clamps can merge. Only blocks of the same size can merge.
