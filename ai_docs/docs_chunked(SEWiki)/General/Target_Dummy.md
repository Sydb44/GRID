The Target Dummy is a decorative block that was introduced with the Warfare 1 update (1.198).

It is basically a sensor for gunshots. You can use it as an interactive block for target practice with [Character Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons").

## Usage

The Target Dummy is a player-sized, large grid only block made of several destructible subparts: Main body, left arm, right arm, and head.

This robotic target[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) contains a sensor capable of triggering actions when it detects it was hit by bullets.

### Usage Examples

To build a shooting gallery, build a room with some obstacles and attach dummies to [mechanical blocks (horizontal pistons, rotors, hinges)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") at floor height. Then have [timers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") chaotically reverse the mechanical blocks' direction every few seconds, so that they irregularly appear and retreat behind various obstacles.

You can also use it as secret button: Hide the dummy behind any kind of embrasure in your base wall so that it's not visible from the outside. Then set up timers to open the door only after the dummy is hit by a well aimed pistol shot.

### How to make the dummy react

1.  Access the [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") through the [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel "Control Panel") on its backside.
2.  Click **Set Up Actions**. You see two slots.
3.  Define two actions:
    *   The first action slot triggers _every time_ the dummy is hit.
    *   The second action slot triggers after the top half of the dummy has been destroyed.

For example, use the actions to play [sounds](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sound_Block "Sound Block"), run [scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripts "Scripts") on [programmable blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block"), flash lights, open doors, move the dummy [mechanically](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks"), and so on. To trigger several actions together, put them in a [Timer Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") and make the action start the Timer.

### How to make the dummy repair itself

The Target Dummy can self repair after its top half has been destroyed, so it will be ready for your next round of weapons testing.

1.  To enable this feature, fill the block's inventory with up to 30 steel plates through the conveyor system on its bottom side.
2.  To have time to see the effect of your weapon test, configure the regeneration delay. You can choose a value from 1 to 60 secs. By default, it regenerates after 5 secs.

You can also disable auto-regeneration to define a winning state in a contest, such as, all dummies being destroyed.

Note: The Target Dummy does not self-repair after non-combat types of damage, such as grinding it down. Or if you use, say, a rocket launcher and blow it up including the bottom half, it cannot recover without you welding it back together.

## Construction

The Target Dummy block exists for large grid only. Its physical shape is about as large as a player character. It attaches to other blocks only on the bottom side. It consumes no power.
