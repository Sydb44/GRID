The Couch is an alternative seat block on large grids. To build them you must have purchased the [Decorative Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack "Decorative Pack") DLC. Without the DLC, you can equally recharge your suit power in any [Cockpits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit"), [Passenger Seats](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Passenger_Seat "Passenger Seat"), or [Control Seats](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Seat "Control Seat").

## Usage

A Couch acts as a powered [Passenger Seat](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Passenger_Seat "Passenger Seat") to recharge your spacesuit in, or as a safe seat during a [jump](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive"). To sit down, face the couch and press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

In contrast to a [Cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") or [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit"), a couch cannot be piped to gas tanks to refill your suit reservoirs. To not run out of oxygen while sitting, place the Couch in an [airtight](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") room.

After they were built, any Engineer with or without DLC may use this block as a seat. Even though it looks larger, there is space for only one engineer.

Similar blocks are the [Inset Couch](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inset_Couch "Inset Couch"), [Passenger Seat](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Passenger_Seat "Passenger Seat"), and the [Corner Couch](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Corner_Couch "Corner Couch").

## Construction

This block exists for large grid only. You can only add the block to your [Tool Bar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") or place or weld it if you have purchased the Decorative Pack DLC. It takes up a full block when being placed but leaves space to walk in front of it.
