# Docking - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Docking is the process of attaching ships or stations together temporarily.

To configure important docking related keyboard commands, see [Cockpit Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls") after building a ship.

## Docking Use Cases

There is a variety of reasons and use cases for docking, and there are several ways how to do this, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

| --- | --- |Docking Use Cases
| Use Case | Docking Method |
| Docking a ship to an jump ship or mothership that acts as a carrier. | Landing Gear, Magnetic Plate |
| Towing an enemy ship wreck to a station for repairs or salvaging. | Landing Gear, Magnetic Plate |
| A modular station/ship with hot-swappable utility modules that you own and control, and that should not interfere with flight in gravity. | Pair of Merge Blocks |
| Docking to transfer cargo (ores, ammo) | Pair of Connectors, conveyor system |
| Docking to recharge batteries | Pair of Connectors, no conveyor system needed |
| A bendy decoupleable hitch between a trailer and tractor that can convey power and (optionally) inventory | Head plus Stator of Advanced Rotor or Hinge |

## How to Dock Using Landing Gear

_Main article: [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear")_

 [![Icon Block Landing Gear.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png/21px-Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png?d381be)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear")s and  [![Icon Block Magnetic Plate.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Magnetic_Plate.png/21px-Icon_Block_Magnetic_Plate.png?8006b4)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Plate "Magnetic Plate") [Magnetic Plate](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Plate "Magnetic Plate")s are blocks in Space Engineers that can be magnetically attached to grids and voxels.

Their main use is for docking smaller ships onto bigger ships or stations. They can also latch on to hostile ships for boarding or to derelict wrecks for towing.

Pros:

*   The strength of landing gear is that it can be attached to any surface without prior preparation.
*   It can be activated and disengaged at a moment's notice.

Cons:

*   The drawbacks are that the ship's flight computers will not adjust to the new center of mass. Trying to tow a large object attached to the side of a ship in gravity will make piloting it very difficult or even impossible.
*   Landing gear doesn't provide conveyor access nor power transfer.

## How to Dock Using Connectors

_Main article: [Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector")_

For successful docking, each ships requires a connector block. Align the circular openings of the blocks using their magnetic fields, and then lock the connectors through the Control Panel Screen.

Connectors don't require power to dock.

Pros:

*   Connectors form a link between the power, conveyor and computer systems of two ships, even between small and large grid!
*   Allied or neutral Connectors allow docked ships to access terminals of connected ships, transfer cargo through conveyor systems, and share power between the connected ships/station.
*   Docking has a bit of leeway as long as the Connectors are close.

Cons:

*   You cannot use connectors to dock to enemy ships.
*   On carriers and in stations, it's your responsibility to configure your Connector’s [Cockpit Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls") properly so that pressing [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") does not accidentally undock and drop carried ships.

## How to Dock Using Merge Blocks

Using merge blocks to dock small craft to a mothership

_Main article: [Merge Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block")_

For successful docking, each ship requires a Merge block, and you must align the clamps of the blocks using their magnetic fields. Both Merge blocks must be powered to be able to merge.

Pros:

*   Using merge blocks has the benefit of allowing access to the terminal and piloting functions of the attached ship.
*   The center of mass is calculated to include both merged parts, so that piloting while docked is feels natural.

Cons:

*   Merging is not possible between small and large grids.
*   Merge blocks must be perfectly aligned with no leeway.
*   Merge blocks also have the function of _permanently_ fusing two ships, if the full surfaces of any other blocks come into contact, so this docking method requires careful attention when designing the ships if they are intended to only attach temporarily.

## How to Dock Using Rotors and Hinges

_Main articles: [Rotor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") and [Hinge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hinge "Hinge")_

If you detach and grind off the heads of Rotors and Hinges, and rebuild the head on another grid, you can move them together and click a button on the base part's [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") to attach the new head. While this kind of docking is unidirectional (initiated by the side with the rotor/hinge base), once the pair is attached, you gain terminal access, allowing you to initiate undocking from either side of the connection.

Unlike connectors, rotors don't have a break force limit.

Pros:

*   [Advanced Rotors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Advanced_Rotor "Advanced Rotor") and Hinges also possess conveyor ports for inventory access.
*   Mechanical docking is flexible to bend at angles or to rotate like a truck hitch.
*   Mechanical docking also allows [docking of small and large grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/How_to_connect_small_and_large_grid_blocks "How to connect small and large grid blocks").

Cons:

*   The process of attaching through mechnical blocks is a bit fiddly and jerky.
