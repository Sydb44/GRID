# Independent Terran Workers - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The Independent Terran Workers (ITW) are an [NPC faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions") in the [The First Jump Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_First_Jump_Scenario "The First Jump Scenario"). Their faction color is yellow.

## Lore

The settlers maintain a small base on the [Earthlike planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Earth_Planet "Earth Planet") and are in possession of a frigate and a drop ship.

The ITW staff are hired as experts for boring tunnels and excavations, and they likely invented [grinder pits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_Block "Grinder Block") to salvage wrecks and blocks.

The ITW settlers are neutral towards (and sometimes allied with) the [Sol Cooperative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative") faction. ITW used to be allied with the [ROS corporation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") and worked for them until ROS unscrupulously attacked ITW’s settlement to hide evidence of ROS’ theft.
