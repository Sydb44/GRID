# LCC-3 Freighter - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The LCC-3 Freighter is a large small-grid ship that was built to haul heavy cargo. You can buy this ship at [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") owned by a [builder faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions").

## Description

The LCC-3 has three [Large Cargo Containers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Cargo_Container "Large Cargo Container") and one [Small Cargo Container](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Cargo_Container "Small Cargo Container"), ready to carry massive loads through space.

The LCC-3 has an armament of only one gatling turret and it is recommended to attach more turrets to fend off pirates.

It comes with a survival kit and plenty of space for upgrades.

## Modification ideas

You may want to mod the LCC-3 with a jump drive so you can haul cargo much faster across the galaxy to your destination.

The LCC-3 can also be converted into a small mobile base.

## Comparison

In comparison to large-grid ships in SE, such as [Red Corvette](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Red_\(Corvette\) "Red (Corvette)") and [Big Red](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Red "Big Red"), this ship is not particularly large.

The [R.U.S.T. Freighter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/R.U.S.T._Freighter "R.U.S.T. Freighter"), a pirate cargo ship, is a vessel very similar to the LCC-3, the only difference being increased armaments and an assembler.

## Trivia

LCC-3 could mean "Light Cargo Carrier-3", the 3 implying the number of large cargo containers.
