The _best_ way to get nutrition is to choose a Meal Pack. But if your engineer is starving, the _fastest_ way is to eat _raw_ fruit, mushrooms, or vegetables, for 5-6% emergency nutrition. You cannot eat raw grains or algae, only processed. Do not eat raw meat, it will make you hungrier and you lose health.

1.  Open the inventory [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
2.  Drag the food item into the player inventory.
3.  You have two options:

    *   Drag the food into your toolbar, press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and then press the number.
4.  Watch your nutrition and health bars increase slowly.

The nutrition increase depends on the food item. The health increase is generally 10%.

You cannot eat several food items in rapid succession. Wait for the short cooldown to end before consuming more.

## How to store food? Does food go stale?

No, food items do not go stale. You can store food in any cargo container or player inventory.

The DLC blocks such as Fridge, (Inset) Kitchen block, Oven, Microwave, and Coffee Machine are decorative and have no function related to vanilla food production. The Fridge block can store food, but has no further effect.

Rarely, you find "surprise" meal packs that are inedible (it will hint so in its description), but there is no game mechanic to have to keep them fresh. These easteregg Meal Packs cannot be crafted, only found. They may have good or bad nutrition stats.
