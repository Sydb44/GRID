The  [![Icon Block Drill.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Drill.png/21px-Icon_Block_Drill.png?a1b524)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drill "Drill") Drill is a [block tool](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Tools "Block Tools") block in Space Engineers. Players use block drills in Survival Mode as an industrial miner, either to gather ores and ice, or to remove layers of stone (also know as [voxel material](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Voxels "Voxels")), instead of using the smaller [Hand Drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hand_Drill "Hand Drill").

For other ways of removing [voxels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Voxels "Voxels"), see also [Voxel Hands](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Voxel_Hands "Voxel Hands").

## Usage

Using the block drill is similar to how you use a [Hand Drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hand_Drill "Hand Drill"). Block drills produce a hole about three small blocks in diameter and one or two blocks deep, depending on how far the Drill is from the surface.

### How to switch between digging and mining

1.  Open the Drill's [control panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") and
2.  Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Toolbar Config menu](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar")
3.  Drag the drill from the "Block" (!) section to your toolbar and select the **Terrain Clearing Mode on/off** option.
4.  Drag the drill from the "Block" (!) section to your toolbar and select e.g. the **block on/off** option.
5.  Press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the window.

Activate the first toolbar slot to toggle the terrain clearing mode on to dig, or off to mine ores. Then use the second toolbar slot to toggle the drill on and off.

### How to dig (manual control)

Same as hand drills, block drills have a secondary tool mode ([![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")) that simply clears out stone and deletes the chunks (and deletes ores, careful!).

1.  Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Toolbar Config menu](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar")
2.  Drag the drill from the "Block Tools" (!) section to your toolbar.
3.  Press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the window.
4.  Activate the toolbar slot.
5.  [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click to clear voxels.
6.  Double-[![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click to toggle auto digging on/off.

Deleting [voxels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Voxels "Voxels") is useful for getting past the soil layer of a planet, or the outer "shell" of an asteroid quickly to get to the more valuable stone and ore below, without having to mine out and collect lots of comparatively less dense soil.

### How to mine (manual control)

Block drills have a primary mode that mines stone and ores and, unlike the hand drill, sucks them into the conveyor system.

1.  Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Toolbar Config menu](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar")
2.  Drag the drill from the **Block Tools** (!) section to your toolbar.
3.  Press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the window.
4.  Activate the tool bar slot.
5.  [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click to activate the ship drill to collect ores
6.  Double-[![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click to toggle auto mining on/off.

### How to dig out a wreck

If you want to dig out an NPC encounter wreck, you often have the problem that drills destroy blocks. A drill will damage grids but will not destroy the grid it is built on.

So instead of drilling the ground from the outside:

1.  Build the drill, a seat, and a power source _on_ the wreck!
2.  Sit in the seat and hold [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") to clear out the stone surrounding the wreck.
3.  Then grind off and rebuild the drill to reach more areas, repeat.
