## Description

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

The place is defended by three gatling turrets on towers on the outside. A ladder on one side leads up to a small platform with a small wide gate. The gate goes into a storage area room. Behind access panels, you find a cargo container with a selection of ores, a freight with money.

Then you go through a glass tunnel to the living quarters building. Here you find an ATM, and a small sideroom with a crate with weapons and barrels with ores. In this half of the building, there's an Inset Aquarium, Beds, and Couches. After you go through two gates, you are lead to the outdoors again, over a catwalk to a platform with four outdoors cargo containers. This is the main loot, containing Prototech, many ores and freights and barrels with components.

There are several datapads with lore about the place and what the crew thinks about the Prototech components.
