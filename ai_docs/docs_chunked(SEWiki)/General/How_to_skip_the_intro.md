# How to skip the intro

How do I Skip the Game's Intro Video Automatically?

When you start SE, it plays loud harpsichord music and a video shows the Keen Softwarehouse logo. You can press Escape to skip it manually.

Additionally, Steam supports automatic launch options. Here you can enter [Startup Arguments](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Startup_Arguments "Startup Arguments"), one of which lets you disable the intro video and the other the intro splash screen.

1.  In Steam, in the game list, right-click Space Engineers and select **Properties**.
2.  Under General, find **Launch Options**.
3.  Enter launch options into the field: `-nosplash -skipintro`
4.  Click the cross to save and close the dialog.
