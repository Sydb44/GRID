# Drop Pod - Official Space Engineers Wiki

**Obsolete!**  
This article is about something now **obsolete** that is no longer present in [Space Engineers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineers "Space Engineers"). The page stays on the Wiki for historic purposes.

The legacy planetary variant has no wheels and no cockpit

The legacy **Drop Pod,** also named the **Respawn Planet Pod** (its grid name), used to be the [starting](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_game "New game") ship for players that spawn on a [planets or moons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets"), except for the [Moon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Moon "Moon"), before it was replaced by the [Respawn Rover](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Respawn_Rover "Respawn Rover") in version 1.207.

You select your starting location in the spawn menu when starting up the world for the first time, or when respawning upon death.

## Usage

The legacy drop pod (this page) was optimized for planetary landings. It had no wheels, no cockpit (just a seat), no steering capabilities. It had auto-locking landing gear. It had four [Atmospheric Thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Atmospheric_Thruster "Atmospheric Thruster") and one [Hydrogen Thruster](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Thruster "Hydrogen Thruster"), but had thrust only in one direction and hardly enough hydrogen fuel to get far.

### How to fly a drop pod

The planetary drop pod comes with four [Atmospheric Thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Atmospheric_Thruster "Atmospheric Thruster"). With experience and skill, it is possible to fly a drop pod in gravity "helicopter style", for example, if you landed in a location with no ice in walking distance and you want a second chance to find a better spot.

An understanding of [Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression"), [Key Bindings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers") is required.

Prepare the pod:

1.  First grind down the hydrogen thruster under the seat (hard to reach) for spare parts.
2.  Add a [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") to the seat. This replaces a cockpit.
3.  Add a [Gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") to make the drop pod flyable.
4.  While seated in the passenger seat, access the drop pod’s [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"), turn on the option to Show Hidden Blocks (an eye button just to the right of the search field), select the atmospheric thrusters and turn them on.
5.  Click the **control** button of the [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") to substitute the missing cockpit.

How to fly:

1.  Press the spacebar gently to lift off.
2.  Use the mouse (or arrow keys) to tilt the flying pod at 45 degree angles
    *   tilt forward to accelerate,
    *   tilt backwards to brake,
    *   switch off dampers [Z key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to sink, and
    *   switch on dampers and return to the horizontal position to hover.
3.  Return to hovering after every manoeuvre! It's easier to cancel motion in only one direction.
4.  To land, first hover, then strategically toggle the [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers") [Z key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") on and off to control your fall.

Go slow, you’ll spin and crash if you rush this.

Another strategy is to grind down and rebuild two of the thrusters so you have thrust in three directions: two down, one back, one right. The tilt the pod 45 degrees back _and_ 45 degrees right while flying. Your thrusters are now aligned at angles like tripod legs which is more stable.
