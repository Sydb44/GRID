# Emotes - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Emotes are built-in gestures that your avatar, the [Space Engineer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer"), can perform in game.

*   The Engineers's face, which is commonly covered by a space helmet, displays no facial expressions.
*   Emotes involve moving arms, hands, fingers, legs, changing stance or the whole body posture.
*   You can play Emotes while seated, running, and standing, but running and sitting will cancel any leg animations.
*   Several emotes that affect separate body parts can be combined and played at the same time (for example, running while pointing left and right).

## Usage

Emotes are typically used in [multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") to interact with other players in an immersive way, for example, when RP'ing (role playing).

*   Drag emotes from the G-menu and drop them into [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") slots like hand-held tools. Then play the emote by pressing the slot number.  
    Tip: Dropping an emote into the toolbar plays the animation once, so optimally, you set up your emote toolbar (remember, you have nine slots in nine toolbars!) ahead of time, before you need it.
*   Alternatively, open the [chat](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Chat "Chat") console and play one-off emotes by typing commands, such as `/wave`.

One of the [Steam Achievements](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Steam_Achievements "Steam Achievements") is gained by using an emote.
