# Space Standoff Scenario - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Space Standoff Scenario is a [player-versus-player scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PvP_Scenarios "PvP Scenarios") that was included in the free Warfare Evolution Update. This scenario is setting the stage for epic confrontations that will test your team's strategic prowess and combat skills.

## Is this Scenario for me?

[![Space-standoff-scenario.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Space-standoff-scenario.png/320px-Space-standoff-scenario.png?8f86bc)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Space-standoff-scenario.png)

This time limited scenario is for experienced players that understand the gameplay and that know how to build, fly, and fight. To be thrown into this space battle would be overwhelming for beginners, but intermediate players could find a place in a team and learn "the ropes" during their deployment.

## How to Start

You can join free Keen-hosted multiplayer servers or host your own. When you create the game, you choose between a [Multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") access level of Private, Friends, or Public. Maximum number of players is 16.

You join one of two teams, red or blue, 150 km apart in space. Each team starts out in an asteroid base with a few pre-built ships, a fully stocked [assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") (no mining required), tools and equipment. The game starts after the minimum number of players has joined.

You can see your "Data Container" next to your spawn room (don't open or move your container). Your goal is to protect yours and destroy the other team's Data Container before the timer runs out. In the spawn room, grab your equipment and then rush to set up your defences.

## Game Instructions

> "Your team has managed to acquire an encrypted data container that could hold the key to gaining an upper hand in this endless conflict. Unfortunately, your enemy is resourceful and has acquired the same encrypted data from an unscrupulous seller. Now, the race is on!  
> Join The Red team or Blue team, prepare your defenses, and make sure your data container is well defended during decryption. Launch your assault and destroy the enemies data container before they manage to decrypt its secrets! Choose carefully between fortifying your compound, building up a jump-capable strike force, and infiltration of the enemy base. The enemy’s data container must be destroyed!"

## Steam Workshop link

The scenario is one of your available [PvP Scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PvP_Scenarios "PvP Scenarios"), but you can also get it on the Steam Workshop here: [Space Standoff](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3028172563). Modding is encouraged, instructions are in the description

## Future Development and Community Involvement

As of summer 2023, this scenario is considered experimental, because Keen plans that it will change and evolve over time.

Keen encourages the community to run their own (even modded!) versions of the scenario, provide feedback on how Keen should change it and share ideas how to improve it, to make it the best PvP game for the community.

> "Later iterations will enable players to spawn their blueprints. This empowers combatants to “pre-game” and offsets the cost of creation. Prior to playing in a scenario, customization and optimization of designs can be done, much like it is in survival. Players will then bring these optimized designs directly to the battlefield “on demand”." -- Keen

## Trivia

The scenario showcases the new blocks introduced in the free Warfare Evolution and Automaton Updates and from the paid Decorative Pack 3 DLC.

## Minor Spoilers

Explore the base and familiarise yourself with the layout, spawn points, and entrances to protect. In the spawn room, check the Cargo Containers for data pads with the mission briefing, [Medkits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medkit "Medkit"), [Powerkits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Powerkit "Powerkit"), [Oxygen Bottles](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Bottle "Oxygen Bottle"), or [Hydrogen Bottles](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Bottle "Hydrogen Bottle"), enough for seven players.

Apart from the "Data Container", each base contains decoy towers, a cargo ship and a jump carrier, 2 patrolling [AI defense drones](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence"), and 2 agile fighters. You can modify all of them and add defences.

Be [prepared to build](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") your own battle ships and turrets: There are assemblers fully stocked with materials and components. Memorise the locations of tool racks, crates, armories, and lockers because they contain helpful equipment. Keep an eye on your turrets and their ammo.

There are windows, passages, backdoors, and hiding spots for intruders -- on either base...
