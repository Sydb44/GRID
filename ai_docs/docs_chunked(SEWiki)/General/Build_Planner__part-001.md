# Build Planner - Official Space Engineers Wiki

It's a common problem while [building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") that players forget which components they need to bring to finish welding a block. The **Build Planner** is a set of shortcuts that memorises, withdraws, and deposits components for you -- and even can pass on the order to an  [![Icon Block Assembler.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Assembler.png/21px-Icon_Block_Assembler.png?ceefab)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler").

Quick version: [Select](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode") the block that you want to place in your toolbar and [![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-click its ghost preview on a full inventory [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") to quickly withdraw the components for the block.

## Prerequisites

For the Build Planner shortcuts to work, you need access to an inventory access port (e.g. cargo container). For the full functionality, ensure the cargo container is conveyored to an  [![Icon Block Assembler.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Assembler.png/21px-Icon_Block_Assembler.png?ceefab)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") (not a _Basic_ Assembler).

## How to use Build Planner as the Engineer

In this scenario, the source is a mothership or base that has an  [![Icon Block Assembler.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Assembler.png/21px-Icon_Block_Assembler.png?ceefab)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler"), and the target is your engineer's inventory.

### How to queue up components

Use one of two ways to queue up the needed components on foot:

*   If you have placed unwelded blocks, hold your welder and **[![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click** the blocks.
*   Otherwise, select a block from the toolbar as if you wanted to place it, and **[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-click** the ghost preview on the cargo port.

The block's missing components are added to the build queue.

### How to withdraw components

To withdraw the components into your inventory:

1.  To start producing the queued components, [SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-click the cargo port.
2.  To deposit all components from your inventory, [ALT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-click the cargo port.  
    Now you have room to withdraw the right components.
3.  To withdraw the queued-up components, [![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-click the cargo port.

If the engineer's inventory is full, or the components are not yet produced, you'll get a warning. Then try again a bit later.

### How to mass produce components

[SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[![Middle](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png?6ca49a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")\-click the port to put the tenfold amount of queued up components into production.

If you are building the same block over and over, queue it up once and then withdraw without clearing the queue:

## Use Build Planner From a Welder Ship

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/Build-planner-buttons-in-inventory.png?4e9c72)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Build-planner-buttons-in-inventory.png)

For ships and bases: Build Planner buttons in the Inventory Screen

In this scenario, the source is again a mothership or base that has an  [![Icon Block Assembler.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Assembler.png/21px-Icon_Block_Assembler.png?ceefab)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler"), and the target is a welder ship.

Tip: This method works best if you give the target and source inventories unique filterable names. For example, name the cargo containers of the welder ship, "welder cargo TARGET" and the ones of the base/mothership "base cargo SOURCE".

### How to queue up components

There are two ways to queue up the needed components:

The block's missing components are added to the build queue.

### How to withdraw components

To withdraw components into the welder ship's cargo:

1.  Dock the ship to a connector of the conveyor system of the station/mothership.
2.  Press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the ship inventory.
    *   On the left side, filter to show the welder ship inventory only (target).
    *   On the right side, filter to show the base inventory only (source).
3.  To produce the queued components, click the **gear** button in the middle column.
4.  To deposit all components from the left (ship) into the right (base) inventory, click the **right-arrow** button in the middle column.
5.  To withdraw the produced components into your ship, click the **left-arrow** button in the middle column.

You can always hover the mouse over the Inventory buttons to read the tooltips to remind yourself what they do!
