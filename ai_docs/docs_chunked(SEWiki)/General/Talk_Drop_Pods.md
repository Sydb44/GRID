# Talk:Drop Pods - Official Space Engineers Wiki

(#searchInput)

*   Why is this page called _Drop Pods_ rather than _Respawn Ship_ or _Respawn Ships_? (Or even merged with [Category:Respawn Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Respawn_Ship "Category:Respawn Ship"))
    *   Does the Respawn Rover even count as a "Pod"?
    *   The Respawn Space Pod does not drop.

*   Or alternatively, should this article be merged with [Drop Pod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pod "Drop Pod"), and the Space Pod and Respawn Rover be removed from this page?
*   Otherwise, why list historic drop pods in the lead section?
