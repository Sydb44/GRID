2.  Cycle [TAB key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and [H key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") until you see cyan checkpoint signals.
3.  Tip: Press [V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle between first and third person view.
4.  Head for the first highlighted **Starting Checkpoint**, then race for each of the subsequent Checkpoints, until you are back at the finish line.

It's well within the rules for you to disable the pesky competition with well targetted shots or by ramming -- just as your fellow racers will not hesitate to blast you out of the race at the first opportunity. Limited ammunition will be made available to your car after the race commences.

Familiarize yourself with the toolbar controls of your car:

*   Press toolbar slot [1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to enable the front-facing static gatling gun. Click to shoot forward while driving.
*   Press toolbar slot [2 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to manually control the top-mounted turret (use the mouse to aim and click to shoot). You can still use the WASD keys to steer, but if you're aiming the turret backwards, you won't see where you are going. Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to leave turret control and return to your normal driving view.
*   If you flip the car, use toolbar slot [3 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"): **Car Flip** uses a gyroscope override to make the car roll (hopefully) back onto its wheels. Then toggle [3 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") off again to drive on.

The game is timed. If you're too slow, you get teleported back to the start. In the end it will show everyone who won, and then the race will reset.

## Admin Room

At the Starting Checkpoint (also known as checkpoint 12), behind the Lobby, there is an Admin Room whose doors only the host can open. If you cannot open it, use the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") and enable **Can Use all terminals**.

The room offers buttons with the following game rule choices:

*   Start or End the Race
*   Reduce Laps or Add Laps
*   Single Lap or 10 Laps
*   Official Track or Test Track
*   Drop From Race or Join Race -- the player who presses the button drops or joins respectively
*   Clear the weather, or add more dust and sandstorm

## Checkpoints (Spoilers)

There are twelve checkpoints arranged in a circle. They are roughly between 1 to 3km apart as the bird flies (the driving distance is much longer, of course). The Starting Checkpoint (also known as checkpoint 12) is the one with the Lobby.
