All contracts implicitly expect the contractor to bring their own specialised ships for the task! Some contracts are strictly time limited while others have no time limit and can be stacked. Some are tied to specific quest items ( [![Icon Item Package.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Package.png/21px-Icon_Item_Package.png?7bda1c)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package") [Package](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package")s) and you can lose a collateral if you fail, while for others, all you can lose is faction standing. Lower pay means easier.

| **Search** | Find a "lost" ship or cargo container in a few hundred metres radius around given coordinates. A ~25min countdown timer starts when you accept the contract.  <br>Planetary stations give local planetary coordinates; orbital and space stations give space coordinates; players can give any coordinates. | Only accept if you have a fast rover/ship.  <br>Approach the found target until you get a confirmation. NPC-owned targets then disappear, player-owned targets stay. No need to transport the found grid back. | NPC-offered Search contracts are good entry-level jobs. Player-offered Search contracts _could_ be traps. Don't queue up too many, you'll likely run out of time. |
| **Acquisition** | Someone wants to buy quantities of raw materials or components and you acquire and deliver them. Offered anywhere. | Only accept if your ship/rover has cargo space and connectors. You must [own](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") the ship/rover, connect to the neutral or friendly target station, and deliver all items at once. | Jobs vary from entry-level to mid-level difficulty. You can mine / refine / assemble, trade, or steal the requested items -- up to you. Don't accidentally bring ores if it asked for ingots. |
| **Escort** | Meet a flying NPC ship in space and escort it to given coordinates intact. Don't let it be destroyed by space pirate attacks! Only offered in orbital and space stations. | Only accept if you have a fightercraft. | You are allowed to arm and repair the NPC ship in flight at your own cost. |
| **Hauling** | You pay a collateral in exchange for a small item. Transport it to given coordinates to get paid and get your collateral back. If you lose the  [![Icon Item Package.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Package.png/21px-Icon_Item_Package.png?7bda1c)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package") [Package](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package"), you lose reputation and collateral. | Only accept if you have a ship with jump drive and a lander/shuttle, and money to pay the collateral. | See detailed notes about the package and collateral below. |
| **Repair** | Visit and repair a ship at given coordinates to gain reputation and payment. Only offered in orbital and space stations. (?) | Repairing up to the functional line is enough. Only accept if you have a [Constructor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") ship with a cargo hold full of components. | Don't weld by hand. |
| **Bounty** | NPCs ask you to hunt down and kill another player who has low [standing](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") with this NPC faction and high standing with the [SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") faction. The contract reveals the player's last known location. | Only accept if you have a fighter/weapons and enjoy PvP duels. Use a [handheld weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons") for the killing blow! | These contracts appear on PvP multiplayer servers only; they can be disabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings") by the host. |

## How to keep track of pending contracts?

Press the semicolon [; key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the **Contracts Screen**.

This shortcut is useful to review your accepted contracts while you are not in the vicinity of any Contracts blocks. It answers the common question, "Wait, was it 100 iron _ore_ or _ingots_ I was supposed to bring?" Check the Contracts screen on the go if you don't remember what conditions you need to fulfil, or which components or how many materials you were supposed to gather, etc.

## What does collateral mean? What is in "the Package"? (Hauling)

After accepting Hauling contracts, a  [![Icon Item Package.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Package.png/21px-Icon_Item_Package.png?7bda1c)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package") [Package](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Package "Package") item will appear in your [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"). The NPC clients require you to deposit a collateral, an amount of space credits of equal value to the package, as theft prevention.

Outside of the contract, the package item is worthless to players.

*   Failure or theft: If you steal or lose the client’s package instead of delivering it, you do not get your collateral money back. This means, as a penalty, you paid damages for the (for you, worthless) package.
*   Successful delivery: If you fulfil the contract, you automatically get the full collateral back, plus the service payment the client offered!

NPC-generated contracts ask for collateral only in Hauling contracts. Technically, asking for a collateral is optional in all player-created contracts. It makes no sense though to demand a Collateral for other types of contracts where the client cannot lose anything. For example, if you ask the contractor to deliver gold to you, and the contractor abbandons the contract, then you simply don't pay them. You don’t lose anything, so you don’t need to ask for collateral.
