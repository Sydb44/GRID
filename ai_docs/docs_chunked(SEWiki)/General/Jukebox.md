The Jukebox is a decorative block. You can only build it if you have purchased the [Decorative Pack 2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack_2 "Decorative Pack 2") DLC.

The  [![Icon Block Inset Entertainment Corner.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Inset_Entertainment_Corner.png/21px-Icon_Block_Inset_Entertainment_Corner.png?f7bb37)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inset_Entertainment_Corner "Inset Entertainment Corner") [Inset Entertainment Corner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inset_Entertainment_Corner "Inset Entertainment Corner") and  [![Icon Block Media Player.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Media_Player.png/21px-Icon_Block_Media_Player.png?680c4f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Media_Player "Media Player") [Media Player](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Media_Player "Media Player") are blocks from other DLC packs with similar functionality.

The non-DLC  [![Icon Block Sound Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Sound_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Sound_Block.png?ace8e6)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sound_Block "Sound Block") [Sound Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sound_Block "Sound Block") can play the same songs and you can set up a button panel to start and stop playing a Sound Block. Sound Blocks however do not keep a list of selected songs (only one song per Sound Block), and has no button built into its 3D model.

## Usage

This block has an interface from which players can play music from a [selection of songs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Music "Music") included in the game. The physical interface has three buttons, previous song, play/pause, next song, and a built-in display that shows messages or the name of song playing. Aim at the buttons and press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") or the left mouse button (with no character tool or weapon equipped) to push the selected button.

### How to add songs to the playlist

After building the block, the display shows the message: "No tracks available. Select tracks to play in Terminal screen." Before (non-owner) players can play music, the owner has to select songs.

1.  Aim at the display and press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") of the Jukebox.
2.  Choose a **Volume** between 0-100%.
3.  Choose a **Range** between 0-500 metres how far away the sound should be audible.
4.  Repeat the following for each song that you want to include in the selection:
    1.  Select a song from the list (or a loop).
    2.  (For loops only:) Set a **Loop Time** between 1-59 secs or 1-30 mins. This slider is only available after you have selected a loop.
    3.  Click **Add to Selection**.
5.  Close the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").

This is now the selection of songs that can be played by pressing the buttons on the Jukebox in game.

### How to remove songs from the playlist

To remove songs from the selection:

1.  Aim at the display and press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") of the Jukebox.
2.  Scroll down to the **Selected Sounds** list.
3.  Select a song, and click **Remove Selected**.
4.  Close the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").

Removing a song does not delete it from the game, it just does not include it in the selection of this Jukebox anymore.

### Which songs are available

You can add songs to the playlist from

*   the original Space Engineers sound track,
*   the [Sounds of Space Engineers 2021](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sounds_of_Space_Engineers_\(2021_Competition\) "Sounds of Space Engineers (2021 Competition)") contest, and
*   the [Sounds of Space Engineers 2023](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sounds_of_Space_Engineers_2023 "Sounds of Space Engineers 2023") contest.

The song list also contains the [Sound Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sound_Block "Sound Block")'s short spoken alerts ("Lights on!", "Enemy detected!", and similar) and loops (sirens and droning noises) that you can select, but they don't make much sense for use in a Jukebox.

## Construction

If you have [Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") enabled, you need to build several other blocks first to unlock the Jukebox: Basic Assembler -> Interior Light -> Corner LCD -> Sound Block -> Jukebox.

This very affordable block is 1x1x1 blocks in size and only exists for large grids. The block needs a small amount of power to work.
