The HEC is a derelict ship which can spawn if the "random encounters" option is enabled in your [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"). The wreck can be found by following the "SPRT MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's HUD for 1s every minute, from a distance of ~25 km.

Engineers should aproach with great caution, as there are a few still active interior and gatling turrets mounted on the ships hull. Ocasionally, multiple aggressive salvage drones will also spawn next to the wreck.

The ship itself is heavily damaged, as if it was attacked by space pirates, raided, and abandoned.

## The original ship

[The original ship](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=938445456) was built by Jim and uploaded to the Steam Workshop, and adopted into the game by Keen as a random encounter.

## Contents

The ship does not contain any notable cargo, you gain only components from salvaging the wreck, as the most damage to the ship occcurred at the large cargo container section. It is possible to restore the ship, however it is a real challenge in survival mode.
