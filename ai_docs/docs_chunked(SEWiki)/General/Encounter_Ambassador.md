The wreck of the Ambassador

The Ambassador is a large derelict ship which can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is enabled in your world. It can be found by following the "[SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") for 1s every minute, from a distance of ~25 km.

Engineers should aproach with some caution, as there are a few still active battery-powered interior turrets mounted on the ships hull.

## Contents

It contains a broken Cryo Chamber, a mix of hydrogen thrusters and ion thrusters, a reactor with 10 kg of Uranium. As this ship is in a really bad state, it does not contain any notable cargo, only components from salvaging the wreck (steel plates, construction components, and a few metal grids).Â It is possible to restore the ship, however it would be a real challenge in survival mode.

## The Original Ship

[The original ship (Steam)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=877927121) was part of the first campaign in the game. A refitted version of it can be found on Steam by Aragath.
