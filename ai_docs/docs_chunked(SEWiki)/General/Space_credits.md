trading currency

Space Credits (SC) are an in-game currency introduced with the [Economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") Update.

You can use Economy-related blocks, and use SC currency and SC bank accounts, even if you have not bought the [Economy Deluxe Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy_Deluxe_Pack "Economy Deluxe Pack") DLC!

## Economy Currency

SC are the second of the currencies in space engineers, the other currency is [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU"). The currency symbol for Space Credits in Space Engineers is SC. Colloquially, some also call the currency spacebucks.

### Physical Currency

When you withdraw money, it turns into a stack of physical Space Credit items in your inventory. These items weigh <0.01kg and have a volume of 0.01L, which means you are practically not limited in how many you can carry.

You can:

*   drop and pick up Space Credit items
*   withdraw them from or deposit them into bank accounts
*   conveyor or place them into inventories (such as  [![Icon Block Bed.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/d/d9/Icon_Block_Bed.png/21px-Icon_Block_Bed.png?d29901)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Bed "Bed") [Bed](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Bed "Bed")s).

Space Credits will be "garbage collected" if they remain floating objects, and the items can be destroyed in explosions or crashes.

### Bank Accounts

Each Space Engineers has an individual bank account that you automatically connect to when interacting with Economy blocks. The main Economy blocks are the [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") and [Contracts Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts_Block "Contracts Block"), and there are also DLC blocks such as the [ATM](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/ATM "ATM") and the [Vending Machine](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Vending_Machine "Vending Machine"). Here you can check your account balance, and deposit or withdraw SC currency. If the player dies, the personal account remains unaffected.

Faction members additionally have a second, shared bank account that is managed through the [Faction screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") only. All faction members can deposit and withdraw money, so be careful whom you invite into the faction.

If you are a server admin (or you are the default admin of your singleplayer game), you can use the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") to check any player's account balance, and you can even increase or decrease the balances of individual players.
