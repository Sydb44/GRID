# Encounter Ponos-F1 - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The Encounter Ponos-F1 is one of the [Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters"). You will see a SPRT.MAYDAY [signal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal") blink on your [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") for a few seconds.

The Ponos is a non-dangerous ship wreck encountered in space. Finding this ship can be a life saver during a [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") start, since the main loot are survival-related blocks.

Its name possibly refers to Ponos, the lesser known Greek god of hard work.

## Description

The creator called the original ship an autonomous, mobile, instant base for the colonization of planets. The wreck of this civilian or scientific short-range explorer is unarmed and has no jump drive. It was capable of manoeuvring in space and could also land on planets.

Before its demise, it was clearly equipped with survival in mind, sporting 4 cryo chambers, a gravity generator, a medical room, airlocks, and an air vent. In its current wrecked state, it is not airtight, but you could fix it up to be.

The interior is dark and very spartan with lots of narrow passages and winding stairs. The doors of the wreck are stuck open and broken button panels float by in zero gravity.

The bridge in front is encased in glass and the pilot of this exploration ship type had a good panoramic view.

On board, you will also find an ore detector, refinery, and assembler. The ship doesn't have enough cargo containers to be a miner, and there are no visible mining drills; presumably this processing equipment was used only to be autonomous enough to kickstart the assembly of components during longer planetary stays.

The ship relies on a Hydrogen Engine for power (named "Hydrogen Power Generator" in the Control Panel), with two solar cells for emergency jump starts. The propulsion is hybrid, Hydrogen and Ion, with two large hydrogen thrusters at the rear of the ship for planetary lift-off and landing. The ship likely was not intended for longer atmospheric flights.

Mysterious button? (Image source: "Space Engineers Economy Only #4" video by Splitsie)

There can be a small-grid antenna and button inside the wreck that are not visible on the ship's control panel. A small text panel says "Perform scan to retrace hidden cargo. Can also attract unwanted visitors." The functionality is unknown, maybe it was meant to run a script that broke in recent years?

A copy of the mysterious object can be found on the workshop named [Probe](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2719015808).
