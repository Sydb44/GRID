If the founder leaves, then the faction has no founder and the remaining players should start a new faction with a new founder.

## How to Promote/Demote Members?

As the Founder or Leader, you will see new membership applications in the members list of the **Factions** tab. Members will possibly also contact you with requests to change their permissions here.

Founders or Leaders can:

*   To turn an Applicant into a Members, select the player name and click **Accept**.
*   To turn a Member into a Leader, select the member name and click **Promote**.
*   To turn a Leader into a Member, select the member name and click **Demote**.
*   To unlock buildable block recipes for a player, select the member name and click **Share Progress**. (Only if [Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"))

## What is Faction Reputation?

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Faction-standing-mouse-over-example.png/320px-Faction-standing-mouse-over-example.png?7938a5)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Faction-standing-mouse-over-example.png)

A hover tooltip lists faction alliances.

To see a faction's allies, go to the **Faction** tab, and hover the mouse pointer over a faction name.

Knowing alliances is important because [automated turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") distinguish friends, neutrals, and foes based upon faction membership and reputation. By default, turrets will not target members of the owning faction or allied factions.

*   **Neutral:** A reputation of -500 to 500 is neutral. You can trade with neutral NPC [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"), but get no discounts. Turrets don't target neutrals, unless players have configured them to do so.
*   **Enemy:** A reputation of -1500 to -500 is the worst. Ships of hostile NPC factions will attack you when you approach and not let you trade at their stations.
*   **Ally:** A reputation of 500 to +1500 is the best reputation. You can trade with friendly NPC [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") and get up to 10% discount when buying, and up to 5Â % bonus when selling there. Turrets will not target allies by default.

All player factions start out neutral. On a multiplayer server, faction founders manually change the reputation among player factions by declaring war or peace. Use this to help your team members (and your turrets!) keep track of whom you trust or don't trust.

You can never have 100% good or 100% bad standing with all NPC factions simultaneously, because NPC factions have implicit allegiances, and improving your standing with one NPC faction can unbeknownst to you decrease/increase your standing with another.

Certain [NPC factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions"), such as [SPRT Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") and [The Factorum](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Factorum "The Factorum"), start out as hostile. Destroying other factions' blocks decreases your standing with them, but increases your standing with the Pirates, until they become your allies. [The Factorum](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Factorum "The Factorum"), however, always stay hostile.

## How Does Reputation Improve/Worsen?

Hover the mouse over a faction name on the Faction tab to see a faction's allies.

*   You raise your reputation with NPC factions by fulfilling their and their allies' [contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts") at [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts"). Good reputation gains you better trade prices at allied NPC Outposts. This is a way to schmooze your way into the heart of an NPC faction that is nearby and sells what you need.
*   You worsen your standing with NPCs by attacking their or their allies' ships. More and more Trader NPC ships will start shooting at you and Trading Outposts will lock their doors to you. At the same time, this increases your standing with the [SPRT Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates").

To change your reputation with a player-owned faction, select them on the Factions tab and click **Declare War** or **Propose Peace** -- then negotiate in chat. Wait for their Founder to accept or decline. Your standing with players influences the behaviour of automatic turrets and is otherwise only relevant for role playing.

In general, grinding down or shooting at faction-owned grids decreases your standing with that faction. Other actions that lower reputation include [hacking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking"), attacking faction members, grinding or shooting their turrets and doors, and so on.

Destructive actions against NPC factions increases your standing with the [SPRT Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") until you become their ally. This may be of interst to players who want to found a pirate faction. The Pirate faction can have trade stations as well. If you want to return to trading, fight pirates to turn the pirates hostile again, this will slowly make the NPC traders become neutral towards you, so you can trade with them and gain their favour again.

## Which Factions Are Here?

You may want to look up which NPC factions or Player factions exist, what their reputation is, and who the members are.

On the Faction tab, filter the list by:

*   All -- List all factions
*   Show Me -- List your own faction quickly
*   Non Player -- Show only NPCs factions, for example, NPC traders
*   Show Friends -- Show factions who are your allies
*   Show Enemies -- Show factions that have declared war
*   Show Neutrals -- Show factions that have not gained or lost any repuation with you yet
*   Unknown -- Show undiscovered factions, typically, NPC traders
*   Discovered -- Show NPC factions that you have encountered (or all player factions)
*   Players Factions -- Exlude NPCs
