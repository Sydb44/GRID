## Description

You can obtain this ship in game from [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") that are owned by [builder factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions"). It may vary in price from 5,000,000 space credits to 9,000,000 space credits.

The single [02/H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") helps increase its range and makes this ship useful since it can immediately convert ice to gas and save cargo space. The lack of cargo containers means that the cockpit and connector have to fill the role of temporary ice containers. If you modify the ship and add cargo containers, be very careful with this ship's mass when operating in the gravity fields of moons or planets.

This ship does not have an ore detector, so either add one or at minimum bring a hand drill sensor for it to be an effective mining tool. Optimally, it is deployed only after a larger ship has detected and marked the ore asteroids.
