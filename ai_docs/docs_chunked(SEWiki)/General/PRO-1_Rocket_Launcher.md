Engineer taking cover with rocket launcher

The PRO-1 rocket launcher is a precise [player weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons") that shoots rockets. Due to its recipe requiring Platinum, expect this to be a mid- to end-game weapon, especially also because you must recharge it with expensive [Rockets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") that require Uranium.

## Upgrades

It comes in two variants, Basic ([RO-1 Rocket Launcher](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/RO-1_Rocket_Launcher "RO-1 Rocket Launcher")) and Precision (PRO-1 Rocket Launcher). You can recognise the precise rocket launcher in your inventory by its reticle symbol.

## Assembly

You create the PRO-1 rocket launcher in the [Tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool "Tool") tab of the [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler").
