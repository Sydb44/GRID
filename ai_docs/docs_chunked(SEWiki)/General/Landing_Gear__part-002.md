### How to use wind turbines on a mobile base (using Landing Gears)

Mobile large grids cannot use wind power because  [![Icon Block Wind Turbine.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Wind_Turbine.png/21px-Icon_Block_Wind_Turbine.png?e3c447)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wind_Turbine "Wind Turbine") [Wind Turbine](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wind_Turbine "Wind Turbine")s produce power only on stationary bases.

However, wind turbines will work while the grid is made temporarily stationary with landing gear against a stationary grid:

1.  Build turbines on the mobile base. Notice they don't work.
2.  Build a landing gear on the side of the mobile base. Do not use hinges or other mechanical blocks.
3.  Build a small temporary tower of static blocks on the ground in front of the landing gear.
4.  Drive forward and park, locked against the static tower.
5.  The grid is now static. The wind turbines start working and can recharge your batteries.

When you want to start driving again, unlock the Landing Gear, grind off the little tower, and become a mobile grid again. The wind power will stop again.

### How to tell whether a Landing Gear is locked

The "foot" of the landing gear has a colored ring around it that provides status info for troubleshooting. You can see the same info spelled out on the Control Panel Screen and inside the toolbar slot as well.

*   White - The gear is not within range of a suitable surface.
*   Blue - The gear is in auto locking mode and will lock as soon as any mass is in range.
*   Yellow - The landing gear is not yet locked, but is within range of a suitable surface to attach itself to.
*   Green - The gear is magnetized to a surface and secured.
*   Red - The gear is Turned off or has no power.

An indicator in the [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") informs the player whether landing gears are [engaged](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls").

### Should Autolock be on or off?

Autolocking is not always desireable, better make it a toggle on the toolbar.

*   If you want to quickly grab a floating grid, or touch down quickly in an emergency, or if your drop pod is rolling down the hill, then autolock may save the day.
*   On the other hand, a crane grabbing a block from a specific angle, or for a utility vehicle that uses Landing Gear for stabilisation, benefit more from precise manual locking.

### What can landing gear NOT do?

## Construction

The landing gear attaches to whatever is directly beneath the pads and is unaffected by objects next to them. This allows landing gear to be recessed into the hull for a more streamlined appearance, similar to [Magnetic Plates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Plate "Magnetic Plate").

*   It can be effective to build an armor skid plate around landing gear as armor blocks are more resilient to impacts. This can allow a small ship to perform a "combat landing" with reduced risk to the landing gear. So long as the landing gear itself is not damaged, the ship will still be able to engage magnetic locks. The damaged armor segments can be repaired later.
*   Another option is to use large ship landing gear or [Magnetic Plates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Plate "Magnetic Plate") as a landing pad for smaller ships, and double-lock them (both large ship and small ship engage their landing gear). This has the advantage that large ship landing gear have a longer locking range than small ship landing gear do. If the small ship's landing gear are flush or nearly so, this can result in the large ship gear also grappling the small ship's hull, for added strength.
*   Landing Gear and Magnetic Plates can magnetise through thin blocks (such as Windows, Catwalks, Panels).
