# Builder - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The Builder is a utility ship

The Builder is a [pre-built](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Built_Ship "Pre-Built Ship") [constructor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") type ship that is included when creating a new world from the ["Red Ship" and "Green Station" legacy games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content").

## Description

This iconic ship type was added to the game in [Update 01.031](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Version/01.031 "Version/01.031"), along with the ship-sized [Welder](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_\(Block\) "Welder (Block)"). As its name suggests, this craft is specialised in [construction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") work in space, with a secondary use as salvager. It is not capable of atmospheric flight.

## Usage

The built-in large cargo container is already filled with valuable components, so newly arrived crew at this space station can immediately get to work and weld up damaged ships and stations.

The Builder pilot can weld up _damaged_ blocks, but if blocks are completely missing, install a [projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") on the damaged grid that projects the damaged grid's blueprint. Thanks to the projection filling in the gaps, the Builder can quickly weld up even missing blocks.

If components, ores, or ammunition are seen floating in zero gravity after a crash or battle, the Builder pilot approaches them with the front Collectors to pull the salvage into the cargo container.

Similarly, to salvage whole blocks from wrecks, the Builder pilot uses the grinder, which dismantles the block and places the gained components into the cargo container, for later use in welding up the next ship.

## Environment

The expected use case for the Builder is to be deployed near a space station or interplanetary mothership where it can refuel. Its power system is fully Uranium depended and the ship lacks batteries, to reduce mass in favour of the large cargo container.

The Builder's small ion thrusters are comparatively weak because the ship is meant to do slow precision work close up. A larger ship has to drop it off at the work site, it is not intended to race through interplanetary space.

Its life support consists of an independent O2/H2 Generator filled with ice and some spare enhanced tools in the cockpit inventory.

## Trivia

This ship showcases the use of a  [![Icon Block Conveyor Frame.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/3/39/Icon_Block_Conveyor_Frame.png/21px-Icon_Block_Conveyor_Frame.png?2921e5)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Frame "Conveyor Frame") [Conveyor Frame](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Frame "Conveyor Frame") which connects the 2-blocks deep O2/H2 Generator to the conveyor system next to Collectors that are three blocks deep.
