*   If the countdown is ticking down, click **Stop countdown**.

The warhead then becomes inert and non-explosive, and damage just damages it as any block.

Under normal circumstances, an armed warhead can be disassembled with a grinder without risk of explosion, even if it is owned by an enemy faction. However, using an [Event Controller](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Event_Controller "Event Controller") or [Programmable Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block") it is possible to set a trap where a warhead will detonate when grinding begins, so be careful!

### How to build torpedoes

Using [Artificial Masses](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Mass "Artificial Mass") and a [Gravity Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator"), or Thrusters set to Thruster Override, you can propel a Warhead towards a target, effectively creating a torpedo. Add [Automaton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automaton "Automaton") blocks to build guided missiles. Such torpedos or missiles are called [Player Built Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Built_Weapons "Player Built Weapons") (PBW).

Using Landing Gear to hold on to armed Warheads in battles carries a high risk of them detonating prematurely in crossfire, unless the Warhead is well enclosed or decoyed.

In Creative mode, players can cheaply copy and paste PBW torpedoes and flares containing Warheads, but in Survival mode, it is often more affordable to shoot [Rockets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket "Rocket"). Rockets are both cheaper to produce and more accurate when fired, although the expensive custom-made PBW does enjoy the possibilities of near-unlimited range and being built with either remote-steering or autonomous homing.

### How to build traps

You can combine Warheads with [Sensors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor"), or use other creative ways to ignite them in the perfect moment.

You can use a ship wreck as [trap](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Booby_Traps "Booby Traps"): Set the ship to thruster override so the other player follows it. Place one of the ship's reverse thrusters so that its exhaust will damage and detonate the armed Warhead. While the trap ship flies forwards, it doesn't use the reverse thrusters. When a player takes over control and turns on the [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers") to brake, the reverse thrusters ignite the warhead. Some [Pre-Built Ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Built_Ship "Pre-Built Ship") use this method, so check the Control Panel thoroughly.

## Damage

Note that the warhead area of effect obviously differs depending on its size:

*   The small-grid warhead disintegrates small blocks in a 20 block diameter (5 metres) and barely deforms one layer of large-grid light armour.
*   The large-grid warhead disintegrates large-grid blocks in a 12 block diameter (30 metres) of any block size and will crack through and damage half a dozen layers.

## Construction

If [Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is on, you need to build a refinery, an assembler, and a reactor first to unlock the Warhead.

Both size variants take up 1x1x1 blocks of their size and have mount points on any side. A large warhead has a control panel, so when you place it, remember to rotate it to keep it accessible. A small warhead has no control panel, so you need to either attach it to a grid that has access panels, or attach a [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel "Control Panel") block to the warhead.

You can attach warheads to voxels, or to static or mobile grids. Or you arm and unmerge them in mid-air so they drop onto the ground (or float in space, respectively): Loose warheads can be used like mines, or you let them roll downhill on a countdown towards an enemy.
