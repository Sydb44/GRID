## Lone Survivor

Apparently, all the ships have left without you. This is a good starter map for engineers who want to progress from creative mode to survival mode.

On this map, you find yourself alone on an asteroid mining platform with multiple functioning utilities at hand: Beacon, Control Seat, Refinery, Assembler, Small Reactor, and Medical Room. Survival could be easy if you [manage your power and oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support").

From here, you can start building up your own space station and spaceships. You can resort to mining, salvaging, or piracy. Tip: Use the set of upside down Landing Gears to magnetically hold any ships to be repaired or wrecks to be salvaged in zero gravity.

Asteroid belt only, no planets, no objectives.

## Rival Platforms

This map is similar to the "Lone Survivor platform" (see there for details), except that now there are two identical asteroid stations near each other.

This used to be the start for quick multiplayer games with two players or two teams in a competition, for example, a space race for who's the first to progress to building a spacecraft or fighter.

Asteroid belt only, no planets, no objectives.

If it isn't listed, enable [Experimental mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode")[\[2\]](#cite_note-2).
