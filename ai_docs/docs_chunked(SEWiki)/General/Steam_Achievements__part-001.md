The legit way is completing Economy [Contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts"), or [Player Trading](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Trading "Player Trading") in multiplayer, which takes a while. Cheating is easy in singleplayer through the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen").

## Scenario Achievements

## The Story Begins

Finish [The First Jump Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_First_Jump_Scenario "The First Jump Scenario"). It's short and linear, just follow the story.

## Engineering Degree

Finish all tasks of the [Learning to Survive Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Learning_to_Survive_Scenario "Learning to Survive Scenario"). The tasks are marked with beacons.

When you move further along the scenario, you will go out of range of some of the task beacons and may miss them. Simply backtrace to the ones that you can still see until you get into range of the missing beacons again. To track whether you have completed 11 tasks, back up each beacon with an (infinite range) [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") marker of your own.

## Promoted Engineer

Complete the final objective of the [Learning to Survive Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Learning_to_Survive_Scenario "Learning to Survive Scenario"). After completing all scenario tasks (in other words, you have completed the "Engineering Degree" achievement), you'll get the necessary instructions for the final objective automatically.

You'll be given coordinates. Destroy (that means, power down) an armed NPC base on a planet and then destroy an armed NPC ship in space to gain this achievement. You can take as much time as you need to prepare, for example, to build RC fighter drones.

## It Takes But One

Complete all [Learning to Survive Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Learning_to_Survive_Scenario "Learning to Survive Scenario") objectives without dying.

Click to view spoiler

Take as much time as you need to prepare. If you build [RC](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") drones to fight, _you_ won't die.

## Planetesphobia

Disable the final [Learning to Survive Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Learning_to_Survive_Scenario "Learning to Survive Scenario") objective without entering the planet's atmosphere.

Click to view spoiler

Make sure to stay out of the gravity field of the planet. The atmosphere of the target planet starts at 50 km above the final objective. Build drones, decoys, or guided missiles, and remote control them to spy on and destroy the planetary objective's defense from above.

## Playing it cool

Complete the [Frostbite Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Frostbite_Scenario "Frostbite Scenario") (paid DLC). This is a long and difficult scenario for advanced players.
