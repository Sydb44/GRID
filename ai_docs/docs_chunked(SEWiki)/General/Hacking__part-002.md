## What can be hacked?

Decorative blocks and armor cannot be hacked nor owned. Only functional blocks and grids have [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") and can be hacked. Hackers transfer grid ownership to themselves on the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") after all functional blocks have been hacked.

### Can I hack Prototech Blocks?

Hacking Prototech blocks is the same:

1.  Point your grinder at the block and note the components highlighted in red in the tooltip - don't grind those components, they will turn into [scrap](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech_Scrap "Prototech Scrap").
2.  Note that the [Prototech Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech_Panel "Prototech Panel") are _not_ red and can be grinded and will be placed in your inventory (just be careful that your inventory is not full).
3.  Proceed to grind down all components including the computers to the hack line.
4.  Re-weld everything, as usual.

## Why canâ€™t I hack this?

The owner of a [Safe Zone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone") can disallow grinding and welding inside. In this case, you cannot hack any blocks inside the Safe Zone, either.

## Alternatives (Mods)

Some mods simplify the hacking rules so you do not have to hack all functional blocks, but only certain control blocks:
