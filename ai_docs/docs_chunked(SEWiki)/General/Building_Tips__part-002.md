*   You understand that per-block [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") and [faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Faction "Faction") sharing settings determine whether your faction members, neutrals, or enemies can use a functional block that you added.

In Creative Mode:

*   You enable [Symmetry Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") to automatically place mirrored blocks along mirror planes.
*   Before copying grids, you consider that where you aim the crosshairs determines the pivot point for grid rotation after pasting.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)
*   Before pasting grids, you know to hover the ghost preview over an existing block to make it snap and align.

## For experienced builders

*   To help you build very complex grids, or to build the same grid quickly or repeatedly, you use [blueprints](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") in a [Projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") or a [3D Printer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer").
*   You can place blocks while sitting in a cockpit by enabling [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode").
*   In singleplayer, you use [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode") to build without movement restrictions.
*   You can use a [Safe Zone](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Safe_Zone "Safe Zone") force field as [building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") guide[\[3\]](#cite_note-3), for example, to measure a rectangle or radius or to build something spherical.
*   You use the [Spawn Menu](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spawn_Menu "Spawn Menu") in Creative Mode to get any items, or to even add whole new planets to a game save.
*   You use a third [Gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") on zero-rpm override as automatic stabiliser when flying, driving, or [walking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker").
*   You know that [multigrids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") allow for cool [mechanical](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") structures. However for some blocks, the hit boxes of the first build states are slightly larger than of their final welded state, which can cause placement issues in survival mode that aren't present in creative mode.
*   If the functionality or hitpoints of the block are not essential for your build, you can leave blocks in unwelded build states for different visual aesthetics. In Creative Mode, you grind down blocks to achieve the same effect.

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Block_stages.png/320px-Block_stages.png?6d3f92)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Block_stages.png)

Unwelded blocks have several build states that can be used for aesthetics.

Experienced players also know how to use the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") to quickly find drifting ships and teleport to them, to delete block debris, and to identify causes of performance issues.

## Which blocks are available to me?

When you watch videos or look at screenshots, you sometimes notice that other players use blocks that are not listed in your [Toolbar Configuration](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar").

There are different reasons why this happens:

*   [Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is enabled and you have to unlock the block first.
*   The block is from a [mod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods") that you have not installed.
*   The block is from a [DLC](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC_and_Achievement_Icons "DLC and Achievement Icons") that you have not bought.

If you cannot find out which block it is, ask on the community forums (Reddit, Steam, Discord, etc).

## How to specialize your ships

### Why not build one ship that does it all?

Technically, you could build a Swiss Army Knife style ship with everything, atmospheric and hydrogen and ion thrusters and jump drives. Why shouldn't you?

It's because blocks also have mass. In atmosphere, you'd be carrying the dead weight of unused ion thrusters; in space, you could jump only half as far due to the extra mass of unused thrusters. In contrast to station grids (whose mass does not matter), mobile grids get more sluggish with increasing mass.

You cannot infinitely improve the performance of a ship by adding infinitely more heavy blocks to it. Don't make your ships a "Jack of all trades and master of none".

### How to optimise ship performance?

If you build separate ships for separate purposes you can save mass by only including the minimum needed functional blocks. Specialising a grid means that you ask yourself what each grid's priorities and purpose are, and then make it the best at doing that.

Ask yourself questions like:

*   "Is this mothership a densely conveyored production facility or a roomy repair hangar?"

*   "Is this small-grid ship an atmospheric shuttle or a space-only fighter?"

*   "Is this large-grid ship a heavy cargo hauler or a fast-jumping interplanetary explorer?"

*   "Is this wheeled vehicle a lightweight racecar, a survivalist ATV, or an armored crew transporter?"

*   "Is this ship small and compact to fit though a hangar door, or is its purpose to carry other ships?"

And so on! One grid cannot be everything, certain things are mutually exclusive, make your choices.

For example, it's smart to add hydrogen thrusters to an atmospheric or ion ship; shuttles are often hybrid so they can transition between space and atmosphere. But this means that the ship's specialisation is now "having boosters". Since you need to carry extra hydrogen tanks, you'll have less available capacity for additional specialisations.
