Cyberhounds were hostile terrestrial NPCs added in Update 1.115 (early 2016), replaced later with [wolves](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wolves "Wolves"). If enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), Cyberhounds spawn on the [EarthLike Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EarthLike_Planet "EarthLike Planet") and attack players and buildings. They were disabled by default because they are buggy.

## Description

Cyberhounds used to have robotic features. They can be killed by [Block Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") and handheld [weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons"). After being killed, you have a short timespan to loot their corpses for random components.

## Attacks

Cyberhounds were replaced by non-explosive[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) more natural looking wolves. If you enabled them now, they chew[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) on your ships, rovers, and stations, and attack players at close range. Their pathing and AI is not stellar and they often get stuck on corners.

## History

The Cyberhounds' main attack used to be to explode if they could not reach the player. However, Earthlike was supposed to be a safe starter planet for beginners, so having hostile NPCs spawn there wasn't very popular, and many players asked to disable this feature. The massive voxel deformation their explosions caused also affected performance negatively, so they were nerfed[\[3\]](#cite_note-3).

## Trivia

In creative mode, a player can use a [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") to turn their engineer into a wolf.
