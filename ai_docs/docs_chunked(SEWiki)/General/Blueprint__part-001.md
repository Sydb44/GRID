Engineers often ask:

*   How can I make a backup library of my favourite ships?
*   How can I share grids with other players?
*   How can I "copy and paste" ships in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode")?
*   Which folder do I copy when I move to a new PC?

The answer to all these questions is blueprints [F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

## What is a blueprint?

A blueprint of a [grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") stores all blocks, their names and positions, their colour and skins, their [control panel configuration](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") and [PB scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block"), [configured toolbars](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") and [block groups](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Groups "Groups"). Blueprints can also include DLC blocks and modded blocks. Blueprints do not contain voxels or voxel excavations.

You can use blueprints in [Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") and in [Creative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") worlds.

Blueprints are the best way to design ships in one world and recreate them in another: When Creative-style Copy and Paste is not enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), [blueprint projections](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") are a valid in-game way to copy grids.

A blueprint contains author name, type ([large](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") or [small](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid")), number of blocks of that type, and size in megabytes.

## How to download others' shared blueprints

Other players have created and shared great things! Subscribe to blueprints to make them available in your game.

1.  First you must subscribe to some blueprints:
    *   Log on to Steam, go to the workshop, select **type:blueprints**[\[1\]](#cite_note-1), and subscribe to blueprints:  
        [https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=244850](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=244850)
    *   Or log on to mod.io and subscribe to blueprints there, respectively:  
        [https://spaceengineers.mod.io/](https://spaceengineers.mod.io/)
2.  In game, press [F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and open the Blueprints screen. It shows local and subscribed blueprints.
3.  Click the button that looks like a page with symbols to cycle through filters:
    *   Show all blueprints
    *   Show only saved locally or only in the Cloud
    *   Show only subscribed through Steam Workshop or Mod.io
4.  Search for the blueprint that you want to use.
5.  Click it to view it.

In creative mode, copy the blueprint to your clipboard and [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") paste it. In survival mode, build a [projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector"), select the blueprint there instead, project it, and weld it.

## Prerequisites

If the thrusters are _off_ when you take the blueprint, then the blueprint's thrusters will be off, too. If the thrusters are _on_, the blueprint's thrusters will be on. And so on. Consider in which situation you intend to use this blueprint!

For example:

*   Do you intend to [paste](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") it in mid-air? Then keep the thrusters on. Or do you intend to 3D-print it? Then switch the thrusters off to not burn the [3D Printer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer").
*   Ask yourself this question for each block: Do I want the batteries on recharge/discharge/auto? Hydrogen tanks on stockpile? Antenna, beacon, lights, on or off? And so on.

Before blueprinting, prepare the [grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid"):

1.  [Name the grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen") uniquely. There are no folders on the Blueprint screen and you want to be able to find it again.
2.  Name functional blocks and block [groups](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Groups "Groups") inside the grid uniquely. (Or, if not possible due to mass-production, use [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") instead of groups.)
3.  Configure the grid's [cockpit toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") (if applicable).
4.  Decide for each functional block whether you want it on or off.
5.  Important: Always switch off self-projectors.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)

Tip: If you want to check the point around which the blueprint rotates before you take a blueprint, open the [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen"), and enable the **Show [Grid Pivot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid_Pivot "Grid Pivot")** checkbox.

### How to name non-functional blueprints

When blueprinting, for example, a ready-to-weld wall or floor segment that has no cockpit and no terminal access, the problem is that you cannot open its [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen") to name it. How to work around that?

1.  Temporarily build a [Control Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel "Control Panel") on that grid.
2.  Use that panel to access the grid's [Terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal"), open to the [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen"), and name the grid.
3.  Grind off the Control Panel. (!)
4.  Take the blueprint.
