# Encounter RS-1217 Transporter - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The RS-1217 Transporter is a derelict ship which can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is enabled in your world. It can be found by following the "[SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") for 1s every minute, from a distance of ~25 km. It is most commonly found close to an asteroid or even buried in one.

Engineers should aproach with great caution, as there are a few still active interior and gatling turrets mounted on the ships hull.

A possible backstory of the wreck is that the RS-1217 got attacked by space pirates on its way transporting cargo to a far away planet. The pirates rigged the ship and left it drift decades ago.

## Traps

There is one warhead mounted on the wreck, which is activated by sensors.

## Contents

The ship does not contain any notable cargo, only components from salvaging the wreck. It is possible to restore the ship, however it is a real challenge in survival mode. The ship contains multiple decorative DLC blocks, which will be visible, but cannot be used and will not provide components if destroyed, if the player does not have the DLC installed.
