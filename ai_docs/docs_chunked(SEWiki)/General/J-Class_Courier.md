The J-Class Courier is a ship for sale at [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") if [economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") is enabled.

As expected for a courier, it is a weak but fast hybrid cargo sprinter. With its exposed functional blocks in the hull, and only rudimental armament, it is not suited for a fight, and its survival strategy is a speedy retreat.

Its propulsion is ion, supported by a minimum of atmospheric thrusters, just barely allowing for planetary takeoff and landings (you may want to upgrade). The "J-class" refers to it having a jump drive, which makes it a suitable purchase for completing [Contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts") with deep space stations.

The ship has a glass cockpit with a good panoramic view, and a small interior for a pilot and copilot.

It uses no hydrogen and is powered solely by 2 reactors that you must supply with Uranium.

Purchasing it costs 90 million space credits and uses up 2174 of your [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU").
