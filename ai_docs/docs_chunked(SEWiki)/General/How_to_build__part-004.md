### How to make a grid mobile

Add the following blocks to build a mobile grid:

1.  To be able to turn (yaw left and right), or to level (pitch up or down) a mobile grid by moving the mouse, add [gyroscopes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope").
2.  To control a mobile grid as the player, add a [cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") block (or a [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") or [Automaton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automaton "Automaton") Block).
3.  To be able to accelerate and steer a mobile grid using the WASD keys, add one of the following mobility block types:
    *   Either [thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster "Thruster") in all six directions,
    *   or [wheels and suspensions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension "Wheel Suspension"),
    *   or [mechanical legs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks").

For all planetary vehicles and walkers: Keep the Center of Mass low and the wheelbase wide. Place heavy blocks like batteries and cargo containers low between the wheels to prevent flipping.

## Is there an undo command?

There is no built-in undo command in a physics simulation where objects can be in motion at any time. Instead, you save often, and reload when there’s need to revert to the previously saved state.

1.  Quick-save the game by pressing [SHIFT+F5 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
2.  Quick-reload by pressing [F5 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), which is basically a manual undo/revert.

If you are at a stage of building where you undo a lot, and you want full manual control about what is being saved, temporarily switch off Auto-Save in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

## Creative Mode Keybinds

In [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"), with a block selected from the toolbar, you can [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-drag to place several of the same bocks.

You can use [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[C key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to copy the targeted grid into the clipboard, including its inventory. Then optionally [rotate](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") the ghost preview into position, and paste it with [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). If you align the ghost preview with an existing grid, they automatically merge into a single grid when pasted.

You can use [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to cut the targeted grid. Cutting means, you keep a copy in the clipboard and delete the grid from the world. The next grid you copy or cut will replace the contents of the clipboard, so don’t forget to paste the copy if you don’t want to lose it.

## Tutorial Videos

One way to learn the process of building is to watch the included videos: Press [F1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") in game. You can even watch them offline.

Also watch the helpful videos shared online by the Space Engineers community, such as [Splitsie’s tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/Splitsie).

## What next? How to interact with blocks

You cannot interact with unfinished (unwelded) block frames.

You can interact with marked areas of welded-up functional blocks. For example, you commonly push [buttons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Button_Panel "Button Panel"), open or close [doors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Door "Door"), enter [cockpits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit"), open [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cargo_Container "Cargo Container") [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port"), configure blocks through [built-in keypads](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel "Control Panel"), and more.

To interact:

1.  Weld up the block to a functional state.
2.  Aim and hover the crosshairs over the interactive area until a yellow highlight appears.
3.  Interact with the block by [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-clicking, or by pressing [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
