# How to trigger Pirate Encounters on any map

Do you need a worthy opponent to test your battle skills against, without mods? You can add pirate drones to an existing vanilla Survival game that did not have them from the start!

To replicate pirate base behaviour:

1.  In the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), make sure that **Enable Drones** is active.
2.  Switch the game to [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") and load it.
3.  Add some enemy bases to your [Blueprints](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") menu — either self-made or from the [Workshop](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Workshop "Workshop"). Make sure they are [powered](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power"), have some defensive turrets, and have an antenna.
4.  Paste the base [blueprints](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") into the world.
5.  Set the name of the antennas literally to one of the names listed below, e.g. “NO TRESSPASSERS”!
6.  Set the enemy base's antenna range to not directly overlap with your base — unless you want constant attacks.
7.  In the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"), select all blocks, and transfer the [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") of the whole base to the [SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") faction — and run away quickly. ;-)
8.  Close the game and switch it back to [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode").

The following list of pirate-spawning antenna names was collected from the source files by [Spaceman Spiff](https://steamcommunity.com/app/244850/discussions/0/4627984302692576783/):
