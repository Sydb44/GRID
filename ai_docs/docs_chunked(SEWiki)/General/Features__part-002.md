## Platform Differences

The different versions of Space Engineers have their individual restrictions due to the platforms (PC, console) they are on. This starts with the Steam Workshop only being available to the Steam version of the game, only mod.io is platform agnostic. A game world may contain [fewer planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Star_System_Home_System "Star System Home System") on consoles than on PC.

The most impactful difference is which types of [mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods") are supported: Due to platform restrictions (which are rooted in Microsoft XBox and Sony PlayStation policy, KeenSWH has no ability to change these), scripts are heavily restricted on consoles. This means that a significant portion of mods available for the Steam PC version of the game cannot (and likely will never) work on the console versions of the game. While some mods can be run strictly server side, which allows them to be used on dedicated servers (DS) that console players can join as well, this is not the case for a large number of them.
