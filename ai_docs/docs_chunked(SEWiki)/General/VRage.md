VRAGE is the game engine developed by Keen Software House. VRAGE stands for “volumetric rage” and/or “voxel rage”. The physics engine relies on Havok Physics.

Its main features are volumetric objects made up of blocks on a grid. Blocks can be assembled, disassembled, deformed, and destroyed.

Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia, and velocity. However, VRage 2 does not simulate tensile strength, atmospheric drag, nor orbital mechanics; thrust and torque are applied to the [center of mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Center_of_Mass "Center of Mass") and independent of the placement of thrusters.

Additionally, it supports Voxel terrain.

Space Engineers uses VRAGE2, [VRAGE 3](https://spaceengineers2.wiki.gg/wiki/VRAGE3 "se2:VRAGE3") is in development.
