The vertical bar indicates the integrity (health) percentage of the block.

*   The red "functional" line indicates how much it has to be built in order to [function](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Functional_Blocks "Functional Blocks") and to be [airtight](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") (if it can be at all).
*   The blue "hack" line indicates where you have to grind in order to [hack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking") the block. The position of this is determined by the  [![Icon Item Computer.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Computer.png/21px-Icon_Item_Computer.png?65c1a4)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Computer "Computer") [Computer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Computer "Computer") components.

Then there's the list of components required to fully build the block.  
The component at the bottom is required to place the construction stage of the block.  
The numbers before the `/` (slash) indicate how many components are stockpiled ready to be welded, then the numbers to the right of the slash are how many it requires.

A permanently red highlighted component name will only show up when using a grinder on a block which will **lose** that component if grinded, usually returned as [Scrap Metal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scrap_Metal "Scrap Metal").

When the block is missing a component in order to be welded then said component will be temporarily highlighted red when attempting to weld.

## Help and warnings

By default, game performance warnings appear along the top of the HUD, you can control their appearance in the [Warning Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warning_Options "Warning Options").

Help info boxes (for beginners) and Block Tooltips (for everyone) appear along the right side of the HUD.

Some warnings and tips also appear as text in the middle of the HUD, see [Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options") how to disable them.

## Trivia

The HUD was overhauled in [Update 01.179 Major (Video)](https://youtu.be/RZqxaKUbsFw), along with the rest of the User Interface. That's why older screenshot look different.
