Combine a projector with conveyored block welders to create and advanced assembly line or 3D printer (2014)

If you can't start welding up the projection now, the projected ghost blocks are "unsupported".

1.  Build a row of temporary armor blocks from the projector's grid until they touch ghost blocks of the projection. Touched blocks are supported blocks.
2.  Start welding the first supported block of the projection, which will highlight the next supported block to weld, and so on.
3.  Verify the grid won't fall, then cut loose the temporary row of blocks that have been supporting the welded grid.
4.  Finally, name the new grid on its [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen").

To improve performance, after you're done, click **Remove** to unload the blueprint, and switch off the projector while you're not using it.

### How to "copy and paste" in Survival Mode

In [survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") games, you cannot simply copy and paste grids for free. But making blueprints, projecting, and welding them up, is a legitimate in-game equivalent to copy and rebuild grids. You still spend the materials and welding time as expected in a survival game.

### How to build self-repairing ships

Build a projector on a ship and project its own blueprint _onto itself_. This makes it easy to weld it back up where it was damaged! The only limitation is that each subgrid need its own repair projector.

Make sure to blueprint the ship with its self-projector _off_.

On large ships, you can even pair the self-projector up with internal self-[Welders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_Block "Welder Block") that have conveyor access to pull components. Strategically place these welders so they automatically repair the most important ship parts in a battle (at least until you run out of components).

### How to mass produce ships

A custom [3D Printer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer") setup quickly builds replaceable mobile grids for you: Fighter squadrons, drones, [Player Built Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Built_Weapons "Player Built Weapons") and missiles, portable turret emplacements, etc.

*   Advantages are that it's fast and efficient.
*   Disadvantages are that 3D printers are large and expensive and need to be custom built.

### How to build a welder pit

A welder pit or welder wall is simply a room or wall with multiple [Welder Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_Block "Welder Block") and a projector. Either you move the projection into the weldersâ€™ area of affect, or you move the welders over the projection.

Welding by hand is limited by the player's small inventory size and is very slow compared to an array of [conveyored](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") Welder Blocks which has a much wider area of effect. See also [3D Printer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer") for more welder ideas.

### What else is a projector good for?

*   Quick building of stationary grids:  
    Project and weld repetitive segments of tram tracks, bridges, prefab rooms, space station segments, standard airlocks, repetitive hallways, etc.

*   Building guide:  
    Use the non-solid projection as visual guide while laying out something matching of similar proportions, then switch the projector off and finish building.

*   Decorative hologram:  
    Similar to a [Console Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Console_Block "Console Block"), you can project any shape that you can build[\[1\]](#cite_note-1), non-solid and translucent, for great effect. The only downsides are that the projection is full-scale original size and it's a bit performance heavy.

## Troubleshooting

### Incorrect grid size?

If the projector does not work and a message says incorrect grid size, it means the blueprint and your projector must have the same size. Project a large-grid [blueprint](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") on a large-grid projector, and a small-grid blueprint on a small-grid projector.

### Why can't I weld "unsupported blocks"?

Projected blocks that don't touch solid blocks are called _unsupported_. Unsupported projections cannot be welded because they are hanging in "mid air" and would fall down or drift away. You can weld only _supported_ blocks, which then provide support for their neighbouring blocks, which makes them _buildable_ too, and so on. Fully or partially welded blocks of the projection count as supported solid blocks, as do any blocks of the grid the projector is on.

To be able to see what the game considers supported, use the **Show Only Buildable** setting described in this article.

The easiest way to ensure that your projection has supported --and hence buildable-- blocks, is to build a temporary row of cheap unwelded blocks (e.g. light armour blocks) from the projector's grid to any ghost block of the projection. If the blueprint contains docking blocks, positioning the projection's Merge Block/Connector over a Merge Block/Connector on the projector's grid also makes the docking blocks "supported" blocks.

### Is this thing on?

The color of the Projector indicates its status:

*   Red: switched off or no power
*   Green: powered, no blueprint, idle
*   Cyan: powered, configured, projecting

### How to check build progress

While welding a blueprint, open the Projector's control panel, and look in the bottom right. A scrolling info panel shows build progress expressed in "blocks built / blocks total" format. It also lists the exact blocks remaining to be built, which is helpful to verify whether it's complete. If you see that, for example, a gyroscope or reactor are reported missing, you must find them and weld them up before cutting the grid loose.

A ship with a built-in projector that projects its own blueprint onto itself flies into a welder wall for repairs (2014)

Enable one or more of the following Projector settings:

*   Mark Missing Blocks
*   Mark Unfinished Blocks

While you are 150 m close to the grid, the projector will highlight the blocks with a HUD signal in red or yellow. In multiplayer, it's possible that players don't see the same signals and need to toggle the setting off and on themselves.
