# Encounter Shuttlee - Official Space Engineers Wiki

This [Random Encounter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters") is a small one-person shuttle that has crashed into an asteroid. You can find it when you follow one of the blinking SPRT MAYDAY signals in space.

## Description

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

The wreck is an interesting practical hybrid-ion shuttle that is a Jack of all trades and master of none: After you repair it, the shuttle can fly in space and can also land on planets (thanks to atmospheric thrusters and parachutes), and lift off again (thanks to hydrogen thrusters).

There is no room for a Jump Drive, and being a shuttle, it was meant to return to a carrier for longer journeys. It has weak weapons, low storage, and a bare minimum of hydrogen onboard, so it is not suitable as a hauler or fighter.

On the asteroid, there is also a skeleton and a message on a beacon for you to read. The antenna says "Antenna Shuttlee Proxy".

Tip: Free the ship from voxel using the drill's digging mode and then open the [Info Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen") to turn it into a mobile grid.
