To craft seeds:

1.  Put a Fruit, Vegetable, or Mushroom in the Food Processor's inventory.
2.  Open the Control Panel Screen.
3.  Click Production.
4.  On the left side under Available Production Blocks, select the Food Processor.
5.  On the left side under Blueprints, select Harvesting.
6.  Select the seed harvesting blueprint for the ingredient.

Tip: If you have only _one_ Fruit, Grain, Vegetable, or Mushroom left, convert it to a seed so you can grow more, instead of eating the last one.

Tip: You can also find [Seeds](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") in [Unknown Signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unknown_Signals "Unknown Signals") and as loot.

## How to get ingredients?

Get what? | Get where? Algae | Hydroponically grown anywhere with [sunlight](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Algae_Farm "Algae Farm") and [water](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Irrigation_System "Irrigation System"). Meat | Harvested e.g. from [Sabiroids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sabiroids "Sabiroids") on e.g. the [Alien planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Alien_planet "Alien planet") or [Wolves](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wolves "Wolves") on the [EarthLike Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EarthLike_Planet "EarthLike Planet") Fruit | Found in berry bushes on Earthlike or Pertam Vegetable | Found as green leaves on Earthlike or Pertam Mushrooms | Found on dead tree trunks on Earthlike, Alien, or Pertam Grains | Found in ears on Earthlike or Pertam

Tip: You can also find forageables and Seeds in [Unknown Signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unknown_Signals "Unknown Signals") or as loot.

### How to forage?

1.  While exploring the planet, look for forageables. They look like bushes or tree trunks.
2.  Stand very close and aim at the forageable with no tool in hand ([0 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")):
    *   If it is forageable, a yellow interaction outline appears.
    *   If no interaction is possible, it's not forageable or not ripe.
3.  Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to forage. The food item goes into your inventory ([I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")).

Tip: Make a GPS so you can return after they respawn.

### How to hunt for meat?

To hunt in the wild:

1.  While exploring the planet, look for animals such as [wolves](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wolves "Wolves") or [sabiroids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sabiroids "Sabiroids").
2.  Shoot the animal with, for example, [Character Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons").
3.  Stand very close and aim at the dead animal with no tool in hand ([0 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")) until a yellow interaction outline appears.
4.  Press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") drag and drop the meat items into your inventory.

## How to Farm?

Use [Farm Plots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Farm_Plot "Farm Plot") conveyored to [Irrigation Systems](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Irrigation_System "Irrigation System") to farm:

*   Fruit from Fruit Seeds
*   Vegetables from Vegetable Seeds
*   Mushrooms from Mushroom Spores
*   Grains from Grain Seeds

For details, see [Farming](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Farming "Farming").

## How to craft meal packs?

The second option to craft food is the Survival Kit. It requires that you have working Algae Farms exposed to sunlight.

1.  Open the Survival Kit UI.
2.  Put Algae in the Survival Kit's inventory.
3.  Select the Food Items production category.
4.  Craft Meal Pack (Kelp Crisp).

As soon as you have collected or [grown](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Farm_Plot "Farm Plot") more ingredients, the third and best option is adding a [Food Processor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food_Processor "Food Processor").

1.  Put all ingredients in the Food Processor's inventory (or in a conveyored inventory).
2.  Open the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").
3.  Click Production.
4.  On the left side under Available Production Blocks, select the Food Processor.
5.  On the left side under Blueprints, select Food Items.
6.  Select an available blueprint to craft a Meal Pack or to cook meat.

Available blueprints are shown in a brighter colour, unavailable blueprints are red. The availability depends on your stored ingredients. Hover the mouse over blueprints to get more info. The Meal Packs are sorted by nutrition: The ones towards the end of the list are highest in nutrition, but also need a larger variety of ingredients.

Tip: You can also find [Meal Packs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Meal_Pack "Meal Pack") in [Unknown Signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unknown_Signals "Unknown Signals") and as loot.

## How to eat food?

The _best_ way to get nutrition is to choose a Meal Pack. But if your engineer is starving, the _fastest_ way is to eat _raw_ fruit, mushrooms, or vegetables, for 5-6% emergency nutrition. You cannot eat raw grains or algae, only processed. Do not eat raw meat, it will make you hungrier and you lose health.

1.  Open the inventory [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
2.  Drag the food item into the player inventory.
3.  You have two options:
    *   [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right")\-click the food in your inventory.
    *   Drag the food into your toolbar, press [ESC key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), and then press the number.
4.  Watch your nutrition and health bars increase slowly.

The nutrition increase depends on the food item. The health increase is generally 10%.

You cannot eat several food items in rapid succession. Wait for the short cooldown to end before consuming more.
