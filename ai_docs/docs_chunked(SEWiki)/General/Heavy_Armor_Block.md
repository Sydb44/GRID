It has higher mass and much more hitpoints than a  [![Icon Block Light Armor Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/b/b0/Icon_Block_Light_Armor_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Light_Armor_Block.png?217f89)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Light_Armor_Block "Light Armor Block") [Light Armor Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Light_Armor_Block "Light Armor Block"). It exists in many variants such as  [![Icon Block Heavy Armor Corner.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/3/3a/Icon_Block_Heavy_Armor_Corner.png/21px-Icon_Block_Heavy_Armor_Corner.png?6c6987)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Heavy_Armor_Corner "Heavy Armor Corner") [Heavy Armor Corner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Heavy_Armor_Corner "Heavy Armor Corner"),  [![Icon Block Heavy Armor Slope.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/6/6a/Icon_Block_Heavy_Armor_Slope.png/21px-Icon_Block_Heavy_Armor_Slope.png?b6bfa1)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Heavy_Armor_Slope "Heavy Armor Slope") [Heavy Armor Slope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Heavy_Armor_Slope "Heavy Armor Slope"), and  [![Icon Block Half Heavy Armor Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/1/18/Icon_Block_Half_Heavy_Armor_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Half_Heavy_Armor_Block.png?576a2b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Half_Heavy_Armor_Block "Half Heavy Armor Block") [Half Heavy Armor Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Half_Heavy_Armor_Block "Half Heavy Armor Block").

## Usage

Heavy Armor looks very different than Light Armor, even with the same texture

Armor is the primary structural component of all ships, rovers, and stations, providing a framework to which other blocks can be attached. Additionally, armor provides protection from [environmental dangers, crashes, impacts, and attacks from hostile players](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics "Damage Mechanics").

*   Light Armor is cheap to build and light-weight, but provides only basic protection.
*   Heavy armor provides the best structural integrity and is much more resistant to damage, but has a high material cost and drastically increases the ship's mass.

Note that welded and unwelded blocks have the same mass, but armor resists damage only when fully welded.

It's best to use a combination of armor types.

*   Use Heavy Armor to build the spine that holds your battleship together and to protect vital blocks; use Light Armor for sutble decorative greebling or quick scaffolding.
*   Use Heavy Armor along the bottom of vehicles and Light Armor along the top to lower the center of gravity and increase stability.
*   Use Heavy Armor sparingly because you cannot linearly lift more mass by adding more thrusters (which are themselves heavy).
*   Heavy Armor blocks require extra [Metal Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Metal_Grid "Metal Grid") to achieve maximum durability, whereas Light Armor can be built cheaply from day one.
*   Use Heavy Armor Panels for decoration: Heavy Armor textures look different than Light Armor!
*   On PC, all armors cost 1 [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU"); on consoles, all armors cost 2 PCU.
