The Prototech Jump Drive is an advanced block that allows a mobile large-grid vessel to teleport (that is, travel instantaneously) long distances in space at a speed faster than light. [Prototech](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech "Prototech") blocks are end-game blocks that were introduced in release 1.205.

## Usage

The Prototech Jump Drive has the same usage as the standard  [![Icon Block Jump Drive.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/a/aa/Icon_Block_Jump_Drive.png/21px-Icon_Block_Jump_Drive.png?c39dc2)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive") [Jump Drive](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive"), so see there.

The difference to a standard Jump Drive is that the Prototech Jump Drive has a maximum jump distance of 6000km, three times that of a standard jump drive, and a maximum ship mass before jump distance is impaired of 2,500,000kg, twice that of a standard jump drive. In addition, while they require more stored power to trigger a jump (5 MWh versus 3), they charge twice as rapidly (64 MW versus 32), and are 90% efficient on power usage rather than 80%, meaning it can recharge for jump in just over 5 minutes, compared to 7 minutes for the standard drive, provided sufficient power input is available.

In addition, the Prototech Jump Drive has a small-grid variant, which allows a small-grid ship to jump up to a 500km at a ship mass up to 120,000kg. It requires 1.5 MWh per jump and recharges at a maximum rate of 24 MW with the same 90% efficiency, giving it a full recharge time of slightly more than 4 minutes, though the power demands required to achieve that can be difficult for a small grid vessel to achieve (it consumes the equivalent power of 1.63 small-grid  [![Icon Block Large Reactor.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/1/1c/Icon_Block_Large_Reactor.png/21px-Icon_Block_Large_Reactor.png?f77bf9)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Reactor "Large Reactor") [Large Reactor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Reactor "Large Reactor")s).

The Prototech jump also has a different light effect.

## Construction

To be able to place a Prototech block and build it from scratch, you need 1 uncraftable  [![Icon Item Prototech Frame.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/c/c1/Icon_Item_Prototech_Frame.png/21px-Icon_Item_Prototech_Frame.png?3cac18)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech_Frame "Prototech Frame") [Prototech Frame](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech_Frame "Prototech Frame") in your inventory. You can also free a captured Prototech block from its surrounding grid, [tug](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") it, and [merge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block") it to your ship.

The large-grid variant is 3x3x3 LG blocks in size, and the small-grid variant is 3x3x4 SG blocks.

Compared with the standard large-grid Jump Drive, it takes up slightly more volume (2x3x3 for the standard drive), meaning it might take some redesigning to replace one with the other. In addition, the rounded side has no mount points and is not airtight, which may force some design changes as well.

One side has a Terminal in a player-sized recess, but it is not essential for its function to keep it accessible, it just offers an optional design element for an engine room.
