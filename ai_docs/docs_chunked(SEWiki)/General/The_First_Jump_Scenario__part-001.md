# The First Jump Scenario - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![The ROS-4 moonbase from The First Jump scenario.](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Ros-4-moon-base.jpg/320px-Ros-4-moon-base.jpg?a676ab)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Ros-4-moon-base.jpg)

The ROS-4 moonbase from The First Jump scenario.

The [legacy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content") First Jump scenario used to be the first [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") for beginners.

It follows a clear, linear story and it is very easy to complete even without a walkthrough or prior experience. This is in contrast to the majority of other Space Engineers scenarios that feature unique sandbox environments where players create their own challenges and solutions in a non-linear way.

The scenario's main purpose is to teach players the game mechanics and survival skills while telling an exciting story. The scenario autosaves at checkpoints. You can go back and reload checkpoints later if you desire to replay a scene.

## Can I die/lose?

Sol Cooperative Station from The First Jump scenario.

No. Dying is only possible in rare accidents. If you should find an untimely death, there is no penalty, you can simply replay the scene.

## What is (not) being taught?

*   **In this scenario you will learn how to** walk and orientate yourself, recharge suit energy and oxygen, interact with buttons and doors, fly spaceships, drive rovers, fly with the jetpack, explore bases and tunnels, connect power sources, shoot rifles and ship weapons, fight drones and avoid turrets, use tools for salvaging and repair, and how to place blocks and build them.
*   **This scenario does not focus on teaching** drilling, refining, assembling, and building -- these skills are covered in the [Learning to Survive Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Learning_to_Survive_Scenario "Learning to Survive Scenario").
*   This scenario only covers basic vanilla blocks, no new blocks or new functionality from updates and no DLC blocks.

There are some minor free exploration elements that are easily missed during the first playthrough (see spoilers below). If you find logs, lore, eastereggs, or hidden locations, please add them here!

## Should I play it?

This scenario was originally meant to be the first one for beginners, that means, anyone can play it.

## Spoiler-Free Summary

1.  **Mission 1**  
    Space Station - Your shuttle arrives at a space station where you get caught in the crossfire between unknown combatants. Following the advice of a friendly AI (artificial intelligence), you escape with it to the moon below.
2.  **Mission 2**  
    Moon - No help to be found in the moonbase. You stumble through underground tunnels where something big has recently been dug up. At least you're out of danger--or aren't you? You need to get off this rock and find who is behind all this.
3.  **Mission 3**  
    Earthlike Planet - Newfound allies take you with them. They require your unique skills as a space engineer. You show them what you are capable of and save the day.
4.  **Mission 4**  
    Planet Mars - You and your allies have tracked the attackers to Mars for a final confrontation. In the heat of the battle, you commandeer a tank and breach the enemy base.
5.  **Mission 5**  
    Planet Mars - After the boss fight, you and the AI find what everyone was fighting over.

## Walkthrough (Spoilers!)

| --- | --- |Mission 1: the Contract
| Story | Learn how to... |
| Cutscene: Your [shuttle](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prague "Prague") approaches the moon of the Earthlike planet.  <br>Setting: the [Sol Cooperative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative") space station. |     |
| You wake up in your shuttle's crypopod, being thawed by an artificial intelligence (AI) named [Good.Bot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Good.Bot "Good.Bot"). Go to the bridge for briefing while your shuttle's autopilot docks to the station. The station is not responding to hails -- out the window, you see fire in the station. | Get out of the cryopod ([F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Use WASD and mouse to walk. Open doors ([![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")). Follow GPS markers. |
| You go downstairs to the airlock on the shuttle's lower deck, where you find a blue and a red button panel. You prepare to disembark: You push the blue button to get an oxygen bottle, then the red button to open the hangar door, from where you proceed to the station airlock. | Interact with buttons ([![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")). Pick up an oxygen bottle ([F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Close your helmet ([J key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). |
| You are on the blue [SOL](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative") space station platform above the moon near the Earthlike planet. You see a large yellow ship above the station and drifting debris. The station is reporting heavy damage to systemsâ€”and not the accidental kind. |     |
| You enter the airlock and push the "pressurise" button, while your shuttle's autopilot flies away to a save distance. You proceed through a hangar, looking for the command center on the upper floor.  <br>You manage to get past a stuck half-open hangar door. The station hull is breached somewhere, the supports and floors here look damaged. You must restore room pressure before the system will allow opening any further doors.  <br>You go to the adjacent hangar room and see button panels. There's a big hole in the ceiling and a display indicates that the room is not pressurised. You go to the adjacent Pressure Control Room and push the button to seal and pressurise the hangar. You look up to see ceiling airlock close. Watch the oxygen indicator screen in the hangar until the room is pressurised. | Click or press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to use buttons. Press [C key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle crouching. Understand the concept of [airtightness](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness"). |
| Returning, you can now open the sealed door and proceed to the next room. Your suit is running low on energy, so you follow the "medical bay" marker and recharge. | Aim at its screen and hold [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to recharge your suit's life support. |
| In front of a damaged door, you pick up four components and one tool. Approach the damaged door and repair it. | Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to pick up items into your inventory. The picked up tool will be "in your hand", that is, selected on your toolbar. Hold [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to weld the four repair components from your inventory onto the door. Press [0 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to stow the tool. |
| Continue running towards the station's command center. Out the window, you see the large yellow ship shooting missiles at a blue ship -- your shuttle.  <br>Explosions, alerts, and shots all around you -- run! The station orders another emergency evacuation. Follow the quickest route to the escape pods.  <br>In a narrow tunnel, a malfunctioning welder bot chases you. Run on, through the door. The welder bot gets stuck. |     |
| The exit is blocked. Climb through the collapsed station wall. | Press [SPACEBAR key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")) to jump over the gaps towards the escape pod GPS marker. |
| The station announces another hull breach and life support failure, you hear more explosions and shots outside. You pass another half-open stuck hangar door and run on towards the escape pod marker. Through a large window, you see the moon landscape below.  <br>Follow the signs to the escape pods and sit in escape pod 7. The pod door closes. | Press [C key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle crouching, press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to sit in a seat. |
| Cutscene: Your pod drops down towards the crater-filled moon. You look up and see the ill-fated station burn above you. |     |

| Story | Learn how to... |
| Setting: the moon  <br>You are sitting in the drop pod and the door opens. You see a black sky and regolith (lunar dust).  <br>You take an [oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Bottle "Oxygen Bottle") and a [hydrogen bottle](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Bottle "Hydrogen Bottle"), the [MR-20 rifle](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/MR-20 "MR-20") and ammo. | Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to get up from the seat. If necessary, press [X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to stand firmly on the floor instead of floating in low gravity. Press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") on the container in the floor and drag&drop items into your [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"). Press [ESCAPE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to close the container. Note that the gun goes into a toolbar slot. |
| You step out of the pod and scan the moon surface. The sun is above you and the Earthlike planet at the horizon. Behind you, your pod is nose-down in the regolith. A short distance away, just above the horizon, you spot the tower of a moonbase, and you head for it. | Press [X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to use your [jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") to reach the tower faster.  <br>In your HUD, note the red status hints warning that there is no oxygen and it's freezing--your space suit and (closed) helmet protect you. |
| Outside the [ROS-4](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") base, you first notice a crashed drill ship. Everything here seems deserted. There's a tall tower, a partially broken solar array, a closed hangar with a broken moon rover inside, an empty vehicle platform outside, and a huge closed blast door in the ground. You see glass tunnels leading to pressurised rooms, and to a second, shorter tower building. A bit further away, you spot a locked building with an antenna on top next to a smaller blast door; inside, you glimpse a passage to a staircase down.  <br>You decide to explore the base and find a way deeper into the deserted facility. You enter the "Moon base lobby" through the highlighted door. |     |
| In the lobby, you see a door to the garage and a door to the control tower. A locked door goes back outside towards the tall tower.<br><br>Optional: Go through the door labeled "garage" to the moon rover hangar. There is a button to open the hangar door to go out onto the moon surface. The vehicle cockpit is too damaged to drive and it's missing two wheels.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) A cargo container provides bottles and weapons, if needed.<br><br>Go through the door that says "control tower/life support" and through a glass tunnel. Now you can go three ways: To Life Support, to Elevator, or to Control Tower.<br><br>Optional: Go into the Life Support room to recharge your suit energy, if needed.<br><br>Go to the Elevator. You find that the elevator is locked.<br><br>Go to the Control Tower to lift the security lockdown. On your way upstairs, you see a low building with an antenna through the window. Upstairs, you push the button that unlocks the blast door below. |     |
| Cutscene: the large blast door opens and reveals a deep cylindrical shaft down. You also notice that the stuck elevator door opens. |     |
| The AI wonders why the main shaft is so deep. It wants you to find an explanation and asks you to investigate the excavation site in the tunnels. | Press [L key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to toggle your suit lights. |
| Go downstairs and return to the elevator room. Enter the elevator and push the button. The elevator goes down and you see the deep shaft from the inside. When the door opens, you're in an underground cavern with cargo, batteries, tanks, medical room, and three passages. You look up to see the main shaft above you. In a side room, you spot four automatic defense drones â€” the AI indicates they are offline.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) |     |
| Explore the three passages.  <br>Along one tunnel uphill, you find a half-open room with a view down into a large chamber. Here you find a dead body, cryopods, a medical room, and a reactor. On a screen you see a log message by a worker worried about a colleague who was mesmerized by what they found in the artefact chamber down here, and equally worried about their own stress levels. | You can find dead bodies, better rifles, more ammo, some more offline mining drones, and explosives. Remember you have a jetpack. Activate the reactor by transferring ([I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") uranium from the cargo container nearby to the reactor to enable cryopods for yourself. |
| In the artefact chamber, you see a hole, another abandoned mining drone, two more defense drones, a spotlight, and a projector with a button panel. The log message on a screen nearby says that the artefact has already been extracted and sent to the research team at their main base. Push the button on the central platform. |     |
| Cutscene: A projection shows a 3D scan of the mysterious artefact--It is long gone. Suddenly, the defense drones and mining drones activate.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3) |     |     |
| Shoot the drones down or simply flee through the tunnels back towards the exit marker. Back at the tunnel entrance, you see the blast doors above you close shut. The remaining defense drones activate.  <br>Run for the elevator and push the button. Halfway up, the AI stops the ascend and opens the door at a maintenance level. Exit the elevator and go through the maintenance door. | Press a number key to select the rifle in your toolbar and click to shoot. In the hallway, you find more ammo and bottles, if needed. |
| Follow the marker to the last remaning spaceship. A watchful red eye spots you â€” defeat its turret to proceed. | Press a number key to select the rifle in your toolbar and click to shoot. |
| You reach an underground bunker. The bunker is actually below the small antenna building you saw on the moon surface earlier. Downstairs inside the bunker is a rocket at the bottom of the second, smaller cylindrical shaft. Approach the rocket docked over the platform and enter the cockpit. Above you, you see blast doors open. | Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to sit in the cockpit. Press [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to unlock landing gears to ready the ship. Hold [W key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to lift up in the rocket. |
| You escape and fly towards the "Nav Comp coordinates" marker, where you encounter the yellow fleet. The yellow faction explains their side of the story: They are not the enemy of [Sol Cooperative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative") and were not shooting at _you_. You just got caught in the crossfire between the [Independent Terran Workers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Independent_Terran_Workers "Independent Terran Workers") (ITW, yellow) and [Results Oriented Sciences](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") (ROS, red). ROS unscrupulously eliminated the hired ITW workers after they excavated a valuable [artefact](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Monolith "Monolith") under the ROS-4 base. The remaining ITW workers want to prevent ROS from exploiting the artefact. They take you to their settlement on the Earthlike planet below. |     |
