### Version [1.191.0](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Version/1.191.0 "Version/1.191.0") Major

[Reference](https://forum.keenswh.com/threads/update-1-191-build-planner-small-grid-cryo-pod-and-style-pack.7403193/)

Release Date: 6 June 2019

**Introduction:**

Hello, Engineers!

It’s time for another major update. We have been very busy since the release of Space Engineers from Early Access. We continued working on the game improvements and in this update we focused on a new feature: Build Planner, and one new block: Small Cryo Pod and on customizable game elements, such as skins, emotes and armor skins.

The Build Planner feature allows players to create a list of blocks or components, which can be automatically transferred into their inventory. It significantly simplifies the gameplay and we are sure that you will appreciate it. Special thanks to one of our top community members DraygoKorvan, for the inspiration to create this Build Planner.

For players who wish to support the further development of Space Engineers, we have created a Style Pack for $5.99USD which consists of two character skins, four character emotes and two armor skins. With this release, we are also bringing two new character skins to the game: NextGen and Fiber. Both character skins are only decorative and you can buy them in the Steam Item Store. The price will be set to $3.99USD per skin set. We decided to keep the same approach as with our last update, being that if you decide to not buy the Style Pack/character skins, you are still getting a major free update containing all the gameplay features! This gives you the opportunity to enjoy new things, but also the chance to support the further development of Space Engineers, if you are willing to do so.

**FAQ**

Q: Why are the two individual character skins not included in the Style Pack?  
A: The reason for not having these individual skins to be part of the Style Pack is because these are two specific skins were developed separately from the Style Pack. As these two skins are unique, we wanted to give players the opportunity to buy them individually in case some people do not want to buy the entire pack. We also want to see if players are more interested in packs compared to individual items or perhaps both.

Q: Why did you increase the price of the Style Pack compared to the Decorative Pack?  
A: The complexity and technical requirements are different for these two packs. We spent much more time working on the Style Pack than on the Decorative Pack. The Decorative Pack was also the first DLC we released after Space Engineers moved out of Early Access and it showed us that many members of our community are willing to support us. Therefore, we invested more time and effort to bring some game changing things to Space Engineers now and we plan to continue this for upcoming releases. Another reason is that we wanted to give the Decorative Pack to as many players as possible, and a reduced price definitely helps :)

Q: Can we expect that the next DLC will be even more expensive?  
A: I would not generalize it this way. The price of the DLC is based on the complexity of the content in the DLC.

Q: When we can expect the next update?  
A: The next update is expected to be released similarly to this one, so somewhere between one to two months.

Q: What will be the content of the next update?  
A: I do not want to spoil the surprise, but it’ll be a game changer that will give players a better system for cooperation, as well as certain levels of tasks and goals, which can be managed by themselves
