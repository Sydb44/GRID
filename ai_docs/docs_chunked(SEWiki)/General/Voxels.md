What are Voxels? Voxel is the technical name for the material that makes up asteroids, planets, and moons in Space Engineers. Just as a pixel is a picture element in 2D graphics, a voxel is a volumetric element in 3D graphics.

Voxels are different from [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") and [blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blocks "Blocks") in so far as that they are immobile and never affected by [gravity](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"). This means that you can place voxels in mid air (in Creative mode anyway) and build on them like on any asteroid.

## How to edit Voxels

For details how to add, remove, replace, or reset voxels in [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"), see [Voxel Hands](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Voxel_Hands "Voxel Hands"). In [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"), you can only break or destroy voxels (mine or dig) using a [drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drill "Drill").
