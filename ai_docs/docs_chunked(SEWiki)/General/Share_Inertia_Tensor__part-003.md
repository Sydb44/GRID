## How Does Cross Bracing Stabilise Mechanical Grids?

Space Engineers doesnâ€™t care about tensile strength in static grids, but bending and vibrations become noticeable in mobile grids and mechanical blocks. Or, sometimes you struggle with hinges and rotors being to weak to lift heavy subgrids. How to fix this wobbliness?

Stabilise weak Hinges by adding a flexible diagonal support: The most common cross brace is a piston attached by two rotors.

*   If you use cross bracing pistons, you must actively extend and retract the pistons to control the movement; and you must make the neighbouring rotors and hinges passive by setting a low braking value, no velocity, and no rotor/hinge lock.
*   Do not attempt to actively turn the cross-braced hinges and rotors, because pistons are stiff and cannot be pushed or pulled like spring suspensions in real life.
