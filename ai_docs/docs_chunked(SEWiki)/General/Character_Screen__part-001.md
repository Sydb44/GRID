# Character Screen - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The Character Screen lets you customise your avatar, the [Space Engineer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer"). All engineers look like twins, therefore it's important in multiplayer to choose a colour and suit skin to tell players apart.

Space Engineers avatar - default female and male faces

The Engineer will start in the spacesuit with the default skin in a random color. Standard starting colors are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, and Black.

## How to open the Character Screen

You can change your appearance by opening the **Character Screen** in two ways:

*   In the game at a  [![Icon Block Medical Room.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Medical_Room.png/21px-Icon_Block_Medical_Room.png?a9d978)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room")

*   Before loading a game, on the Main screen, by clicking the **Character** button.

## Change your appearance

[![Character screen.](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Medical-room-space-suit-customisation.png/320px-Medical-room-space-suit-customisation.png?7b2b2a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Medical-room-space-suit-customisation.png)

Players can customise the texture skin and colour of the space suit on the character screen.

All skins have the same functionality, e.g. camo skins do not really camouflage you. Only the looks are different. On the **Character Screen**, you have the following options:

1.  Choose between a **male astronaut** or **female astronaut**. You cannot change the face or body shape (unless you install [mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods")).
2.  Choose styles for your **helmet, suit, gloves**, and **boots**. Each suit part can wear a different armor [skin](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Skins "Skins") if desired.
3.  Choose styles for your tools, **grinder, welder, drill**, and **rifle**. Each tool can wear a different armor [skin](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Skins "Skins").
4.  For the overall suit colour, set the three sliders:
    *   **Hue**: Select a base spectral color. To preview the colour on your suit, first set saturation and brightness to values higher than 50%.
    *   **Saturation**: High to middle saturation results in a strong colour, low values turn any colour grey. Example: Pink is a low-saturation magenta.
    *   **Brightness**: The "Value" slider lets you distinguish non-spectral colours such as black, white, brown, etc.

Some suit parts do not have many coloriseable surfaces.

## How to obtain skins?

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Skin_Crocodile_Helmet.png/320px-Skin_Crocodile_Helmet.png?292464)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Skin_Crocodile_Helmet.png)

Crocodile helmet (unusual rarity)

See [Skins](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Skins "Skins") for details! There are several ways how to obtain new skins:

*   Recycling duplicates for tokens lets you craft new random skins (as described elsewhere on this page).
*   Exceptional and rare skins are for sale as part of [DLCs on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/244850/Space_Engineers/#browse), or on the Steam Community Market.
*   Common and Uncommon skins are for sale through the [Steam Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=244850) for pennies (to complete a set), and available at random for free from [Cargo Drops (PC only)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unknown_Signals "Unknown Signals").
*   The rare Veteran II skin is awarded to everyone who has completed the [Learning to Survive Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Learning_to_Survive_Scenario "Learning to Survive Scenario").
*   Additional wolf and spider skins are available on this screen from a [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") in creative mode.

And so on.

## How to recycle skins?

If you have picked up many [Cargo Drops (PC only)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Unknown_Signals "Unknown Signals"), you likely have many duplicates. On the Character Screen, use the filter to show only duplicates, recycle them into tokens, and exchange the tokens for a random skin.

The filter prevents you from recycling too many skins by accident. Example: If you have 5 rainbow skins, the filter will only show 4, so you can keep one and recycle all others.

1.  Enable the **Recycling** button.
2.  Select a category (Character or Tools) and subcategory.
3.  Select **Show only duplicates**.
4.  Right-click the skin that you want to get rid of and select an option:
    *   Either sell it on the Steam market.  
        Continue in the Steam Market interface.
    *   Or turn it into tokens (destroy).  
        You will see a dialog pop up that says "You got a new item: Recycle Token".

Not every skin can be sold or recycled. The prices for selling "Unusual" or higher items vary greatly, please check the [Steam Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=244850). Common and uncommon skins are traded for pennies, they are cheap to buy and hard to sell.

How many tokens you receive for destroying the item depends on the rarity:

*   Common - Gains you 1 token
*   Uncommon - Gains you 5 tokens
*   Unusual - Gains you 25 tokens

When you have gained tokens, you can gamble for a new skin of a subcategory.

1.  Enable the **Recycling** button.
2.  Select a category and subcategory. E.g. suit, helmet, etc.
3.  Select a target **Item Rarity** that you can afford.
    *   Common - Uses up 4 tokens
    *   Uncommon - Uses up 20 tokens
    *   Unusual - Uses up 100 tokens
    *   Rare - Uses up 500 tokens
    *   Exceptional - Uses up 2500 tokens
4.  Click **Craft for x tokens** to spend ther tokens and get a _random_ skin of that subcategory.
