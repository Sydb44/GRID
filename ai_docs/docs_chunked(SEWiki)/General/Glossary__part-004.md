**Starboard:** adj. Located on the right side of a starship. Can be marked with a green light. Opposite of port. Example: "Open the starboard hangar doors!"

**Star System:** n. A gravitationally bound system in space where planets are in stable orbits around a star. Example: The star system around the star Sol (the Sun) is called the Solar System.

**Stern:** n. The outer rear end of the ship. Opposite of bow. Example: "The stern hit the connector."

**Stockpile:** n. 1) To make a gas tank fill itself and prevent its gas from being used up, set it to _stockpile_. 2) In Survival Mode, a freshly placed block has an empty _component stockpile_. When you single-click the block with a welder and with components in your inventory, the components go into the block's stockpile immediately, as can be verified in the block tooltip. A block can have a full stockpile while being unwelded -- welding takes time.

**Suit Only:** Short for [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") challenge, a difficult custom game mode.

**Supergridding:** An old exploit where you could edit blocks in the save file and change their grid size, resulting in a mix of large and small grid blocks in the same ship.

**Survival Mode:** n. A game mode where building has a material costs, shooting uses up ammo, and the characters need to maintain their health in order not to [die](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death"). See [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"). Opposite of Creative Mode.

## T

**Terrestrial:** adj. On or from planet Earth; on the ground; Earth-like. Example: "Terrestrial [planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") are rocky planets."

**Thruster:** n. A propulsive device for adding controlled manoeuvrability to a ship. In game, either  [![Icon Block Atmospheric Thruster.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Atmospheric_Thruster.png/21px-Icon_Block_Atmospheric_Thruster.png?40659a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Atmospheric_Thruster "Atmospheric Thruster") [Atmospheric Thruster](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Atmospheric_Thruster "Atmospheric Thruster")s,  [![Icon Block Hydrogen Thruster.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Hydrogen_Thruster.png/21px-Icon_Block_Hydrogen_Thruster.png?77ed1d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Thruster "Hydrogen Thruster") [Hydrogen Thruster](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Thruster "Hydrogen Thruster")s, or  [![Icon Block Ion Thruster.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Ion_Thruster.png/21px-Icon_Block_Ion_Thruster.png?6357bf)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ion_Thruster "Ion Thruster") [Ion Thruster](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ion_Thruster "Ion Thruster")s.

**Thrust vectoring:** n. The ability of a spaceship to automatically rotate the direction and intensity of unidirectional [thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster "Thruster") to control attitude or angular velocity in situations where aerodynamic control is ineffective, or where several multidirectional thrusters are too heavy. Only possible with [scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripts "Scripts") in game.

**Tick:** n. A tick is a unit of time used mostly in [scripting](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripting "Scripting"). There are 60 ticks every second, so 1 tick is about 16.67 milliseconds.

**Topside:** n. The upper, dorsal side of the ship. The opposite of keel. Example: "Meet you topside!"

**Tug:** n. A common type of utility spaceship that is purpose-built for controlled dragging. It uses  [![Icon Block Landing Gear.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png/21px-Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png?d381be)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear"), magnetic plates, or rarely  [![Icon Block Gravity Generator.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Gravity_Generator.png/21px-Icon_Block_Gravity_Generator.png?9a1cf8)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator") [Gravity Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator")s as tools to stow cargo, haul salvage, or assist spaceships that cannot reach their berth by themselves.

## V

**Vanilla:** adj. A vanilla game is a game which has not been customized. The ideal vanilla world uses only standard planets, standard settings, no [mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods"), no [scripts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scripts "Scripts"), no [plugins](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Plugins "Plugins"), no [DLCs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/DLC_and_Achievement_Icons "DLC and Achievement Icons"), no [Experimental mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode"). It's the lowest common denominator that works for every user on every platform. For example, Keen [Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Support "Support") will typically ask you to reproduce a reported bug in a vanilla world to exclude the possibility that the issue is caused by a mod.

**Vector:** n. In layman’s terms, an arrow that has a start, a direction, and a length. In maths, a vector describes a position in space relative to a start position by telling you _in which direction_ and _how far_ you have to travel to get from one to the other, as the bird flies. Only used internally in the game, players simply use [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS"). Related example: "Thrust vectoring means controlling the direction and intensity of a rotating thruster."

**Ventral:** adj. Located on the bottom side of a spaceship or vehicle. Opposite of dorsal. Example: "If this shuttle had ventral lights, we could see how far away from the ground we are."

**Voxel:** n. The smallest element that a volumetric object is made of in 3D graphics. In game, asteroids, moons, and planets are made up of destructible voxels.

**VST:** n. The Visual Scripting Tool for Space Engineers is a [Scenario Editor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario_Editor "Scenario Editor") created by Keen Software House.
