The  [![Icon Block Warhead.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/a/ae/Icon_Block_Warhead.png/21px-Icon_Block_Warhead.png?ae681d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warhead "Warhead") Warhead is an weapon [block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block") in Space Engineers. The warhead is a powerful explosive device. Warheads have a greater explosion radius than [Rockets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") but do not come with any means of aiming or throwing them. They are useful as torpedo heads or bombs in wars, when demolishing structures, or as quick mining charges when tunneling through the ground and asteroids. A smaller variant is the [Explosive Barrel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Explosive_Barrel "Explosive Barrel").

## Usage

After being armed, a Warhead is set off

*   by collision with other blocks or voxels
*   by damage from thruster plumes
*   by weapon fire
*   by neighbouring warhead explosions.

Physical contact with a player will not cause it to detonate.

Alternatively, without arming it, players can detonate it manually, either immediately or after a countdown. Players can use this countdown time to get out of its blast radius, or use an [Antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna") and [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") to detonate it from another ship entirely.

### How to dig using mining charges

You want to build a huge hangar or underground base on a planet, moon, or asteroid, but don’t want to spend hours with a digging machine? Drill some tunnels and place armed large warheads in them to clear out rock. Be careful to not blow up the ores.

### How to ignite warheads

*   To be detonated through damage or through the manual detonation button, you must first **arm** the warhead in the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"). An unarmed warhead just gets destroyed like regular blocks after a few shots. An armed warhead will explode very easily after just one shot; so exercise caution when handling anything that contains armed warheads!
*   To detonate after a countdown, you do not need to arm the warhead. Set a **countdown** time to get out of its blast radius.
*   To detonate a warhead from the safety of another ship entirely, attach an [Antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna"), [power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power"), and [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") to the Warhead to access the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") remotely to Arm and Detonate it.
*   To detonate several warheads, stagger them in a chain reaction: One armed warhead can ignite unarmed warheads in its blast radius.
*   To be detonated by proximity of a player or ship, set up a [Sensor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sensor "Sensor") (and possibly [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block")) to trigger the warhead’s actions: Arm and Detonate.  
    Note: Due to server lag, Sensors likely need to trigger at further distances, and Timers after longer delays, in multiplayer versus singleplayer.

### How to disarm warheads

If you or your faction have access to the warhead, you have a chance of canceling the explosion if you can open the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel "Control Panel") (possibly through [remote access](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Access_Screen "Remote Access Screen")) of the warhead quickly enough.

*   If it's armed, click **Arm warhead** again to disarm it.
*   If the countdown is ticking down, click **Stop countdown**.

The warhead then becomes inert and non-explosive, and damage just damages it as any block.

Under normal circumstances, an armed warhead can be disassembled with a grinder without risk of explosion, even if it is owned by an enemy faction. However, using an [Event Controller](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Event_Controller "Event Controller") or [Programmable Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Programmable_Block "Programmable Block") it is possible to set a trap where a warhead will detonate when grinding begins, so be careful!

### How to build torpedoes

Using [Artificial Masses](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Mass "Artificial Mass") and a [Gravity Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator"), or Thrusters set to Thruster Override, you can propel a Warhead towards a target, effectively creating a torpedo. Add [Automaton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automaton "Automaton") blocks to build guided missiles. Such torpedos or missiles are called [Player Built Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Built_Weapons "Player Built Weapons") (PBW).

Using Landing Gear to hold on to armed Warheads in battles carries a high risk of them detonating prematurely in crossfire, unless the Warhead is well enclosed or decoyed.

In Creative mode, players can cheaply copy and paste PBW torpedoes and flares containing Warheads, but in Survival mode, it is often more affordable to shoot [Rockets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket "Rocket"). Rockets are both cheaper to produce and more accurate when fired, although the expensive custom-made PBW does enjoy the possibilities of near-unlimited range and being built with either remote-steering or autonomous homing.
