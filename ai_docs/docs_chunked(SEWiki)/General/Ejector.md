The  [![Icon Block Small Connector.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/a/ad/Icon_Block_Small_Connector.png/21px-Icon_Block_Small_Connector.png?a2278e)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Connector "Small Connector") Small Connector is a small-grid conveyor endpoint in Space Engineers. The Small Connector is a compact variant of the [Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") available only on small-grid ships, such as drones. Once connected, it lets you transfer items across inventories or eject items from inventories into space.

For a larger alternative with the same function, see [Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector"). For an encased variant, see [Small Inset Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Inset_Connector "Small Inset Connector").

Seven Connectors: Inset or cylindrical, large or small conveyor size, large or small grid size

### Usage

The Small Connector is used to release small objects from a small ship's inventory into space, or to drop objects from a small planetary vehicle inventory onto the ground. Depending on the “Max Objects” value in your [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), the ejected objects will soon be deleted.

The Small Connector is also used in combination with a [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"), [Conveyor Sorters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Sorter "Conveyor Sorter"), and [Collectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector"), to transfer items from one ship's cargo hold to another, greatly relieving the player of the need to manually sort or empty containers and move items by hand. A small-grid Small Connector can only convey or eject small items, such as ores, ice, stone, ingots, most ammo (except Artillery Shells, Large Railgun Sabots, Missiles), and a few components and items. For the full list, see the "small" item list on the [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") page.

You cannot connect a Small Connector to a standard-size Connector on either small nor large grid. But you can use a [Conveyor Converter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Converter "Conveyor Converter") to transition between the port sizes. And you can add an Advanced Rotor, grind off the Rotor Head, use the Rotor's control panel to add a small head, and then place a small connector on the small head. This allows you to connect a drone with small connectors to a large-grid carrier ship.

### Troubleshooting

The Small Connector will not throw items out if there are floating objects blocking the way. An indicator on the side of the block will display a red 'x' when this is the case. In space, either carefully move the ship away, or use a station's or large ship's [Gravity Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator") to pull or push the objects away.

## Inventory

With Realistic settings, the Small Connector has an inventory with a capacity of 100 L on small ships. The inventory accepts many types of items, but not all sizes, allowing the transfer of only certain goods. Insert a [Conveyor Sorter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Sorter "Conveyor Sorter") to allow or disallow specific items to be ejected.

If attached to a [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"), the container is flagged to receive pushed items from other blocks. It will pull items automatically from any attached inventories when active.[\[1\]](http://forums.keenswh.com/post/show_single_post?pid=1282594029&postcount=1)

## Trivia

Before the Automaton update, this block was called Ejector.

## Construction

This small-grid 1x1x1 block has one mount point on the back-end only.

*   If you want it transfer items, attach the back-end to a small conveyor [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port").
*   If you want to eject items, the front-end (exhaust) must additionally face open space.
*   Without conveyor system access, it can still transfer power when connected to another grid.

Small Connectors are affordable in early game on as soon as you can build your first vehicles or ships.
