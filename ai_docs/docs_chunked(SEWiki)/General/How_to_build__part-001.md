# How to build - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The main gameplay in Space Engineers is building functional structures such as space ships, drones, rovers, trucks, factories, mechas, space stations, planetary bases, and so on; these structures are called "[Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid")". Grids are made of blocks, blocks are made of components, components are made of materials, materials are made of ores.

This page is an overview of building concepts.

**Tip:** If you already know all the basics from this page, continue with the checklist of further game knowledge at [Building Tips](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building_Tips "Building Tips")!

## What are the Requirements Before Building?

In [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"), you must have [components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component") (such as  [![Icon Item Steel Plate.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Item_Steel_Plate.png/21px-Icon_Item_Steel_Plate.png?437e3a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Steel_Plate "Steel Plate") [Steel Plates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Steel_Plate "Steel Plate")) in your [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") before you are able to place a block; the components are used up over time while welding.

In [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"), you can place all blocks "for free". If you want to practice building without worrying about components in your inventory, the best entry point is to do the [Quickstart](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Quickstart "Quickstart") in [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode").

## How to Place Blocks

Building in Space Engineers means that you place blocks in the world:

1.  First select a [Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blocks "Blocks") (such as a  [![Icon Block Light Armor Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Light_Armor_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Light_Armor_Block.png?217f89)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Light_Armor_Block "Light Armor Block") [Light Armor Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Light_Armor_Block "Light Armor Block")) from the [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") by pressing a number key from [1 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to [9 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") on the keyboard.
2.  Then [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click in the world to place the block frame.
3.  Making placed block frames functional is called [welding](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder "Welder").
4.  Dismantling and salvaging blocks is called [grinding](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder "Grinder").

[![Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Default-toolbar-survival-mode.jpg/320px-Default-toolbar-survival-mode.jpg?bf4cb7)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Default-toolbar-survival-mode.jpg)

The Toolbar contains handheld tools in slots 1-3, then a light armor block in slot 4, and then other common blocks.

When your space engineer is holding a selected block from the [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar"), you have entered [Block Placement Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode"). Holding a block is a prerequisite for certain [keybindings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to work, such as block rotation or [texture painting](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color").

Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to configure your toolbar by adding the blocks you want to build with. When the G-Menu is open, you can also hover the mouse over the Toolbar to read tooltips to identify a block or action. For details, read [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar").

## What is a Grid?

A spaceship, a rover, a base, a mech -- any structure built out of blocks is called a [grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid"). Make sure that the blocks snap together and touch each other when you build to form a grid.

### Large grid? Small grid?

You build either large (think: space station sized) or small (think: car sized) structures.

In game terms, a structure is built out of either only _large grid_ or only _small grid_ blocks. Some blocks only exist in large-grid size, or only in small-grid size, most exist in both sizes. (For exceptions and more complex cases, read about [multigrids and subgrids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid").)

Press [R key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") (or press the same [toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar") slot number again) to toggle between large or small size before placing the block.

  
Look at the icons in the top right of the block tooltip to distinguish large and small grid blocks.
