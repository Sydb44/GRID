The Exhaust Pipe is a decorative block that is basically a configurable particle emitter. Only players who have purchased the [Wasteland Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wasteland_Pack "Wasteland Pack") DLC can build it, but other players can use it after it has been built and shared with them.

## Usage

Add this block to grids to have them emit particle effects. Usage examples include:

*   steampunk vehicles, trucks, or heavy utility vehicles...
*   roaring race cars or speederbikes...
*   industrial bases with smoke stacks or sparking "warp cores" in engine rooms...
*   fake burning wrecks or cosy camp fires...
*   highlighting coordinated [Automaton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automaton "Automaton") swarms...

### How to set an effect

Open the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") to configure the Exhaust Pipe to emit the following particles:

*   electric arc - looks like a Tesla coil
*   car smoke - subtle smoke
*   fire - looks like a flame thrower
*   fire and smoke - flickers like a campfire
*   smoke - dark sooty smoke
*   smoke electric - with added sparks
*   smoke reactor - with added green radiation
*   smoke white - looks like “clean” steam

Each effect exists in a standard and a small size.

Like other lights in game, the effects are sometimes visible through walls.

### How to make effects depend on power use

You can make the intensity of the effect depend on the power use of the vehicle. The more power your vehicle uses, the more visible the effect becomes, which looks impressive on accelerating race cars, or refineries processing ores in smaller and larger chunks.

*   Set **Power Dependency** to 100% to make the effect fully reflect current energy usage.
    *   The effect disappears when the vehicle is stationary.
    *   The effect becomes fully visible when at top speeds.
*   Set **Power Dependency** to a medium percentage, to make the effect always visible while driving and less dependent on the grid’s actual power usage.
*   Set **Power Dependency** to 0% for constant, stationary effects, such as camp fires or smoldering wrecks.

## Construction

The Exhaust Pipe can be built on small and large grids. It uses a negligible amount of power. It’s 1x1x1 blocks large and can only attach to other blocks on the underside.
