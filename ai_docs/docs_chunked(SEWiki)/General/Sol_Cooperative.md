Sol Cooperative is an [NPC faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions") assumed to have affiliation with the Solar system, which Sol and Earth are part of IRL.

The Sol Cooperative uses a color scheme that is light Blue, titanium White, and a bit of black as a tertiary color.

## Lore

The Engineer protagonist in the [The First Jump Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_First_Jump_Scenario "The First Jump Scenario") is employed as a sort of representative or private investigator for the Sol Cooperative to investigate the [ROS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") corporation and the [Independent Terran Workers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Independent_Terran_Workers "Independent Terran Workers").

The Sol Cooperative is shown to be capable of creating advanced Artificial Intelligence, and it is their A.I. (aptly named [Good.Bot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Good.Bot "Good.Bot") in game) that helps Engineers along their journeys in the tutorial scenarios.

Judging by the blue colour scheme, the commonly used emergency pods ([Drop Pod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drop_Pod "Drop Pod"), [Respawn Space Pod](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Respawn_Space_Pod "Respawn Space Pod")) are possibly produced by the Sol Cooperative faction as well.

## Trivia

In real life, the CEO and founder of Keen Software House (which created Space Engineers), Marek Rosa, is also the CEO and Founder of GoodAI, a company dedicated to the research and development of general artificial intelligence.
