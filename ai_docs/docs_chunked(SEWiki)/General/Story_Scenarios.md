# Story Scenarios - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Story Scenarios are a type of [New Game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_Game "New Game"). Story Scenarios are guided starting points for beginners, and for anyone who wants to discover what the game offers in addition to the pure sandbox experience. These world maps come with [pre-built](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Pre-Built_Ship "Category:Pre-Built Ship") ships, rovers, bases, and [lore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lore "Lore") that you can explore, use, and modify at your own pace.

## Lost Colony

The [Lost Colony Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lost_Colony_Scenario "Lost Colony Scenario") runs on PC only.

Contact has been lost with a remote colony and it’s your job to find out what happened. Embark on an exciting journey through a planetary settlement, caves, and bunkers, while exploring the valley’s history by reading data pads left behind by the colonists.

No enemy NPCs, but watch out for traps. You can play this exploration scenario in singleplayer or multiplayer. The map contains settlements on an [EarthLike Planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/EarthLike_Planet "EarthLike Planet") complete with caves to explore, and you are provided with multiple trucks and rovers to drive. You don't need to build anything to complete this, but you need to understand refining, assembling, and welding.

## Learning to Survive

[Learning to Survive Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Learning_to_Survive_Scenario "Learning to Survive Scenario") is a longer, in-depth tutorial that also gives beginners the opportunity to test what they have learned.

Each asteroid base presents an educational challenge to solve an engineering task. Here you learn about practical space engineering, base building, ship building and flying, production, salvaging, drone remote control, and you can test it in planetary and space battles.

In the end, you'll gain several rare [Steam Achievements](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Steam_Achievements "Steam Achievements")! This singleplayer intermediate map includes many asteroid bases and ships to learn from, a planet and a moon, and some PvE drone battle.

## Never Surrender

In the [Never Surrender Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Never_Surrender_Scenario "Never Surrender Scenario"), you build and prepare defences, alone in singleplayer or with friends in multiplayer. Protect your beacon from endless hordes of hostile NPC drones. How you defend yourself is up to you!

Some experience with ship and base building is expected, and you will improve your building skills every time you replay this scenario.

You can gain several [Steam Achievements](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Steam_Achievements "Steam Achievements") by defeating enemy waves. This map contains planets, asteroids, drones, and your starter ship.

## Frostbite

The [Frostbite Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Frostbite_Scenario "Frostbite Scenario") requires the purchase of the Frostbite DLC.

You are a member of a salvage crew which has been tasked to procure valuable containers from planet [Triton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Triton "Triton"). This is a challenging PvE survival scenario and it’s recommended to team up with friends in multiplayer to solve it.

Explore the planet, overcome numerous engineering and logistics challenges, fight enemy drones, build defenses, and avoid traps.

This story is set on the moonless ice planet Triton which is shrouded in snowstorms. You'll encounter multiple settlements and drones, and you can use multiple trucks and rovers.
