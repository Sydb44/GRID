# Trading Outposts - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/f/fb/Unyielding_Inventors_Orbital_station.png/300px-Unyielding_Inventors_Orbital_station.png?fd1d29)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Unyielding_Inventors_Orbital_station.png)

The Unyielding Inventors faction’s orbital trading station

**Trading Outposts** were introduced in the [Economy](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy "Economy") Update 1.192. They spawn automatically if the "Enable Economy" option is selected in the [Advanced World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

## How Do I Find Trading Outposts

Assuming that Economy is enabled in your world settings, you should come across Outposts by exploration. If you see a HUD message such as "You have discovered..." and an NPC Faction name, then you are near a new faction's cargo ship or station.

Outposts appear in various zones of the world, with several on each planetary body, several in orbit of each planetary body, some in space relatively close to the world center (the Earthlike Planet if using the [Star System](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Star_System "Star System") scenario) (loosely around 7'000km±3'000km) and a lot more in deep space (loosely around 26'000km±4'000km).

**Tips:**

*   Check the seat inventory of your first droppod! If Economy is enabled from the start, it will contain a [Datapad](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Data_Pads "Data Pads") with coordinates of an outpost.
*   You can visit the moons (Moon, Europa or Titan) to easily find your Trading Outpost as they are really easy to find there (multiple per moon).
*   You can buy Datapads from Trading Outposts you find with coordinates of other allied factions' Trading Outposts, it's a good idea to buy all of the available ones to maximize the amount of Trading Outposts you find, you can also wait for an item reroll to buy more of them or if the station is not selling any when you arrive. Remember to double click or enable manually the gps markers after you add them from datapads or they will get deleted after a while!

## Which Services Are Available?

All outposts contain at least a [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") block and a [Contracts Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts_Block "Contracts Block").

*   **Contract Blocks** - Here you can accept randomly generated [contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts") to earn [credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits") and gain [faction reputation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") — or lose it, if you fail to complete the contract. Contracts have different difficulties and refresh several times per day.
*   **Store Blocks** - Use the [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") to buy or sell ores, materials, components, gas, expensive [Zone Chips](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Zone_Chip "Zone Chip"), and cheap [Data Pads](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Data_Pads "Data Pads") (advertising the coordinates of other Trading Outposts). Trade offers refresh several times per day, but no station sells everything. Depending on the NPC faction’s specialisation, some Trading Outposts sell [pre-built ships and rovers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Pre-Built_Ship "Category:Pre-Built Ship") to the player (one of each vehicle type).
*   **ATM Blocks** - Some Outposts offer an [ATM](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/ATM "ATM") where you can quickly withdraw and deposit space [cash](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Credits "Space Credits").
*   **Vending Machine** - Some Outposts offer a [vending machine](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Vending_Machine "Vending Machine") that sells a small subset of the Store goods through a quick-buy button, the Store goods depend on the [type of the faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions") that owns the outpost.
*   **Dispenser** - Some Outposts offer a [dispenser](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Dispenser "Dispenser") that sells drinks that restore a little bit of health.
*   **Oxygen and energy** - Some Outposts contain interactive blocks like beds and toilets that replenish your suit's power for free when using them. Additionally, if the Outpost is pressurized, your suit's [oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") will automatically refill. Sometimes you can buy oxygen and hydrogen to refill your suit at the  [![Icon Block Store.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/2/2b/Icon_Block_Store.png/21px-Icon_Block_Store.png?1936a5)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store").
*   You cannot refill your ship's power or gas for free. [Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") on Trading Outposts are in **Trading Mode** which disables inventory/control panel access and power/gas transfer between the trader's connector and your docked ship. Only  [![Icon Block Store.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/2/2b/Icon_Block_Store.png/21px-Icon_Block_Store.png?1936a5)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") [Store](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") transactions are allowed to buy gas (select a target tank). After undocking, there is an interval when players cannot immediately connect to the same Trading Station again.

You will be able to interact with DLC blocks in the stations regardless of whether or not you own the Economy Deluxe DLC.

## How to get discounts

If your reputation with a faction is above 500, you can get buy discounts up to 10% and sell bonuses up to 5%.

**Tips:**

*   Complete contracts to increase your reputation.
*   Be careful when dealing with other factions, as damaging their grids will lower your reputation with allies.
*   If you manage to find a [SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") Trading Outpost, you can get great discounts by attacking neutral NPCs grids, thus increasing your SPRT reputation (at the cost of your reputations with all other initially neutral factions).
