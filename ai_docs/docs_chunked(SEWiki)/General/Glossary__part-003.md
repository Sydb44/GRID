## L

**Lag:** n. High network latency in an online game means that after a player’s input, the game server’s reaction lags behind, which poses an obstacle in real-time (not turn-based) games.

## M

**Mecha:** n. See [Walker](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker").

**Mechanics:** n. The area of engineering and physics concerned with the behaviour of objects when subjected to forces or displacements. Examples of [mechanical blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") in game are  [![Icon Block Piston.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Piston.png/21px-Icon_Block_Piston.png?8b1fda)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Piston "Piston") [Piston](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Piston "Piston")s,  [![Icon Block Rotor.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Rotor.png/21px-Icon_Block_Rotor.png?127e75)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") [Rotor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rotor "Rotor")s,  [![Icon Block Hinge.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Hinge.png/21px-Icon_Block_Hinge.png?672bc9)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hinge "Hinge") [Hinge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hinge "Hinge")s, and [Wheel Suspensions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension "Wheel Suspension").

**Mod:** n. A mod is a community created game modification, ranging from decorative and functional blocks or skins, to new gameplay, quality of life additions, and whole custom planets. See also [Mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods") and [Modding](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding "Modding").

**Moon:** n. A celestial body of any shape that orbits a larger [planet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") (or rarely, an asteroid) as a natural satellite.

## N

**NPC:** n. Short for Non-Player Character. Computer-controlled characters can be friendly, neutral, or hostile towards the players. They can be faceless minions, helpful workers, or unique opponents. In _Vanilla_ Space Engineers, the only NPCs are [auto-piloted](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Autopilot "Autopilot") or [Automaton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automaton "Automaton")\-controlled drone ships, and rarely [Sabiroids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sabiroids "Sabiroids") or [Cyberhounds](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cyberhounds "Cyberhounds"). See also [Mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods").

## O

**Orbit:** n. In real life, a stable elliptical motion of one mass around another in space. Note: The game does not simulate orbits; planets, moons, and asteroids are immobile in game and don’t spin, either.

## P

**PBW:** n. Short for player-built weapon. A mobile grid built to cause damage, for example, a guided missile. See [Player\_Built\_Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Built_Weapons "Player Built Weapons").

**Pitch:** v. Rotation on the Y-axis, tilting up or down in a head nodding motion. See [gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope").

**Planet:** n. A rounded [celestial body](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") that directly orbits a star on a cleared path, and that itself is not a star. Larger than an asteroid.

**PMW:** n. Short for player-made weapon. Same as PBW, see there.

**Port:** adj. Located on the left side of a starship. Can be marked with a red light. Opposite of starboard. Example "The port turrets are target locked!"

**Proximal:** adj. Of two subgrid blocks, the one nearer to the main grid. Opposite of distal. Example: "The conveyor line is broken somewhere at the proximal piston."

**PvE:** adj. Short for "player versus environment". It describes the situation in a sandbox game where players build bases and ships together and fight against NPCs and environmental dangers. Opposite of PvP. Can be singleplayer or multiplayer.

**PvP:** adj. Short for "player versus player". It describes the situation on a sandbox [multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") server where players challenge each other in battles, make and break treaties, build traps and defences, and attack other factions’ ships and bases. Opposite of PvE.

## R

**RCS:** n. The reaction control system (RCS) is a set of spacecraft thrusters that provides small targeted amounts of thrust for translation (using WASD). The opposite would be the stronger launch or braking thrusters.

**Retrograde Thrust:** n. A braking manoeuvre in spaceflight. Flip the ship 180 degrees so that the strongest launching thrusters face in the direction of travel as braking thrusters, then burn to brake. Same as flip-and-burn in science fiction.

**Roll:** v. Rotation on the Z-axis, a banking motion like cocking your head to the side. See [gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope").

**Rover:** n. A wheeled vehicle engineered to travel efficiently on terrestrial or icy planets with gravity. They can carry a mix of equipment, weapons, cargo, or crew.

**RP:** n. Short for roleplaying, to collaboratively create characters and improvise a story while playing a video game.

**Rubberbanding:** n. In online games, an undesirable effect of latency in which a moving object or player appears to stall, and then leap from one place to another without passing through the intervening space.

**RUD:** n. Short for rapid unscheduled disassembly, an old euphemism for a failed rocket start.

## S

**Sandbox game:** n. A type of game with rules but no “winning” condition nor predefined end goal. Players set their own goals, such as building, fighting, automation, exploration. Can be played by "PvP" or "PvE" rules, and in Creative Mode or Survival Mode, but enforces neither.

**Satellite:** n. A smaller mass in a stable orbit around a larger body in space. Satellites can be artificial (probes, telecommunication devices, space stations) or natural (moons).

**Sim speed:** n. Short for simulation speed. If the game's sim speed is 1.0 or higher, it is running nominally. If the speed is lower, the game has higher latency, which is perceived by players as undesirable lag and rubberbanding.

**Spaceship:** n. A vehicle that is engineered to travel through space for scientific, military, or civilian purposes. Also known as spacecraft or starship. Can be designed for interplanetary or planetary travel. Carries equipment, weapons, cargo, or crew.

**Starboard:** adj. Located on the right side of a starship. Can be marked with a green light. Opposite of port. Example: "Open the starboard hangar doors!"

**Star System:** n. A gravitationally bound system in space where planets are in stable orbits around a star. Example: The star system around the star Sol (the Sun) is called the Solar System.

**Stern:** n. The outer rear end of the ship. Opposite of bow. Example: "The stern hit the connector."

**Stockpile:** n. 1) To make a gas tank fill itself and prevent its gas from being used up, set it to _stockpile_. 2) In Survival Mode, a freshly placed block has an empty _component stockpile_. When you single-click the block with a welder and with components in your inventory, the components go into the block's stockpile immediately, as can be verified in the block tooltip. A block can have a full stockpile while being unwelded -- welding takes time.

**Suit Only:** Short for [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") challenge, a difficult custom game mode.

**Supergridding:** An old exploit where you could edit blocks in the save file and change their grid size, resulting in a mix of large and small grid blocks in the same ship.

**Survival Mode:** n. A game mode where building has a material costs, shooting uses up ammo, and the characters need to maintain their health in order not to [die](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death"). See [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"). Opposite of Creative Mode.
