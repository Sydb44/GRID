The Artillery is a [Block Weapon](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") for large-grid ships. It's the static variant of the titanic [Artillery Turret](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artillery_Turret "Artillery Turret"). Designed for long range engagements, it provides devastating firepower against even the most heavily armoured targets. This weapon has substantial recoil when fired.

## Damage

The Artillery's reload time is very slow, which places it (and its automatic turret variant) among the slowest guns. One shell does a devastating 17000 penetration damage per shot, but the gun can only reload one shell at a time. The trajectory is very far and can extend up to 2000 metres. Because it's very fast you will not have a noticeable drop in gravity.

Artillery shells can ricochet off sloped armor, but will still inflict damage to it. As such, it is not advised to aim at angled sections of the target's hull. These weapons work best when aimed at large clusters of blocks, so their full damage potential can be used, and in case of a ricochet, inflict damage to the surrounding blocks.

*   17,000 [penetration damage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics#Penetration_Damage "Damage Mechanics").
*   [Ricochet](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics#Ricochet "Damage Mechanics"): 85% chance from 0 to 10 degrees surface angle, then chance linearly scales to 25% until 40 degrees, past that angle it no longer ricochets.
    *   If it ricochets: 7,000 damage dealt to the hit block and subtracted from penetration damage.
*   Precision: 0.52m group at 100m (up to 0.15 degrees random offset from aiming line).
*   Reloads for 12 seconds after every shot (resulting in 5 RPM).
*   Round travels at 500m/s, vanishes after travelling 2,000m and it is affected by [natural gravity](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity "Gravity").
*   150 kN recoil force applied to ship.
*   The projectile is a missile type and because of that it can be targeted and destroyed by turrets having "Target Rockets" enabled.

## Construction

The Artillery's size is 1x1x4 large-grid blocks.

## Power

The Artillery consumes 200 W of power all the time while turned on. Firing does not affect power usage.

## Inventory

Its inventory can hold 300L and holds three [Artillery Shells](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artillery_Shell "Artillery Shell"). Artillery Shells are among the more expensive ammunitions, because they require Uranium.  
It has conveyor ports and can be connected to the [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") to automatically pull ammo from containers.

## Trivia

In the game files the Artillery and its ammo is prefixed with "LargeCalibre" and in some cases "HeavyCalibre".
