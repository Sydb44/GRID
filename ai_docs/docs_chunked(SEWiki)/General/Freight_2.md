The Freight 2 is a decorative block for large grid. They are only available for building if you have purchased the [Decorative Pack 2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack_2 "Decorative Pack 2"), but after building, everyone can use the blocks' inventories.

## Usage

The Freight 2 looks like two cubic crates next to each other. Its inventory has a volume of 2000 L (Mnemonic: visually, Freight 2 has two "cubes" worth of volume). Freight 2 is part of a set of decorative cargo blocks and is often combined with [Cargo Crate](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cargo_Crate "Cargo Crate"), [Freight 1](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Freight_1 "Freight 1"), and [Freight 3](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Freight_3 "Freight 3").

The difference between Freight blocks and [Cargo Containers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cargo_Container "Cargo Container") is that Freight blocks are smaller and have no external [Inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") ports, that means that Freight cannot be accessed through the [Conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"). The engineers have to interact with them directly by pressing [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") or using [Build Planner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Build_Planner "Build Planner") clicks.

## Inventory

Freight 1/2/3 blocks have small unconveyored inventories of 1000L, 2000L, or 3000L, respectively. When it is destroyed, it does not drop a [Temporary Container](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Temporary_Container "Temporary Container").

## Construction

Freight 2 exists for large grid only and has mount points at the back, right, and bottom side. The lid is grey and the base is colorable.
