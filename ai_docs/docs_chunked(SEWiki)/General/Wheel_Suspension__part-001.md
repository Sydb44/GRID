# Wheel Suspension - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![Car-with-2x2-wheels.jpg](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Car-with-2x2-wheels.jpg/320px-Car-with-2x2-wheels.jpg?a5aeb5)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Car-with-2x2-wheels.jpg)

To build a wheeled vehicle with WASD controls, add Wheel Suspension blocks. This block comes with functional wheels (do not use decorative [Wheel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel "Wheel") blocks).

Types of wheel suspensions:

*   [Wheel Suspension 1x1](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension_1x1 "Wheel Suspension 1x1") / [Short Wheel Suspension 1x1](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Short_Wheel_Suspension_1x1 "Short Wheel Suspension 1x1")
*   [Wheel Suspension 2x2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension_2x2 "Wheel Suspension 2x2") / [Short Wheel Suspension 2x2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Short_Wheel_Suspension_2x2 "Short Wheel Suspension 2x2")
*   [Wheel Suspension 3x3](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension_3x3 "Wheel Suspension 3x3") / [Short Wheel Suspension 3x3](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Short_Wheel_Suspension_3x3 "Short Wheel Suspension 3x3")
*   [Wheel Suspension 5x5](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension_5x5 "Wheel Suspension 5x5") / [Short Wheel Suspension 5x5](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Short_Wheel_Suspension_5x5 "Short Wheel Suspension 5x5")

All wheels also exist in an [Offroad Wheels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Offroad_Wheels "Offroad Wheels") style variant that is part of the paid [Wasteland Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wasteland_Pack "Wasteland Pack").

## Usage

Add Wheel Suspension blocks to be able to manoeuvre the grid across a planetary surface in gravity using the WASD keys and [SPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Wheeled vehicles use less power than thrusters, but are more hindered by uneven ground. Make sure to enable the checkbox saying **Control Wheels** in the Cockpit's [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").

The Wheel Suspension control panel also has a button to add a functional (unwelded) wheel. In emergencies, an unwelded wheel on its suspension can still roll, it just cannot be steered and has no grip (no friction). A welded suspension wheel can be configured and is almost invulnerable against collision damage, which also makes it a prime choice as [Mech](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker") foot.

### Wheel Suspension Controls

The following controls work consistently only if you've built all suspensions right-side-up.

*   Use the WASD keys to drive forwards/backwards and turn left/right.

*   Press and hold [X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to jump. Holding the key makes the suspensions temporarily compress, which can be useful to connect to a low connector or to get through a low entrance. When you then release [X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), the suspensions relax which makes the vehicle jump up vertically, which can sometimes be useful to get unstuck from uneven ground.

**Tip:** [Group](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Groups "Groups") your wheels on the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") so you can adjust their settings together. You can make several groups, for example, some of the following options apply only to front/back/left/right wheels, while others apply to all of them.

*   **Add Wheel** -- Quickly reattach a missing (unwelded) wheel. Only works if there is enough space next to the suspension!
*   **Steering** -- Whether this wheel should turn left and right when the driver presses [A key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and [D key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Typically for fast vehicles, enable this only for front wheels, disable it for all other wheels ("front steering"). For long and slow vehicles, enable it on the front and back wheels. The turning intensity is controlled by the **Steering Angle** setting.
*   **Propulsion** -- Whether this wheel should accelerate and decelerate when the driver presses [W key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and [S key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Can be enabled on all wheels. The intensity is controlled by the **Power** setting.
*   **Brake** -- Whether holding [SPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") engages the handbrake. Disable this for front wheels to prevent flipping!
*   **Allow Parking Brake** -- Whether pressing [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") engages the handbrake and other docking actions (see [Cockpit Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls")). Disable this for front wheels to avoid flipping!
*   **AirShock** -- In case this vehicle catches air, whether it should automatically extend and strengthen its suspensions in mid air to better absorb the shock impact upon landing and prevent damage of the chassis.
*   **Invert Steering** -- Only used if you enable **Steer Override**, then you must also invert the steering direction of all wheels _on the right side_.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)
*   **Invert Propulsion** -- Only used if you enable **Propulsion Override**, then you must also invert the forward direction of all wheels _on the right side_.

### Wheel setup examples

The following configuration examples mention different extremes: Slow all-terrain vehicles (ATV), heavy cargo haulers, small utility vehicles, and fast racecars:

*   **Steering Angle** in degrees -- When the driver presses [A key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") and [D key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), _how much_ the wheels should turn. Depends on **Steering** setting.
    *   Angle values from 8 to 16 degrees are typical.
    *   Higher values turn slow utility vehicles more sharply, and will outright flip fast or lightweight vehicles.
    *   Lower values are safer but result in wider turning circles.
*   **Power** in percent -- When the driver presses the [W key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") or [S key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") keys, how much the vehicle accelerates/decelerates. Depends on **Propulsion** setting.
    *   Higher power values make vehicles faster on flat ground, able to haul heavier loads, and able to drive uphill, but use up the batteries faster.
    *   Lower power values are used for small slow vehicles which would otherwise flip.
    *   When going uphill, be ready to crank up wheel power temporarily.
*   **Strength** in percent -- How much the suspension resists compressing vertically. You typically want this to be soft, that is, start with 5-10%.
    *   For a slow all-terrain vehicle, use low values, so that the suspension travels more easily, adjusts smoothly, and keeps traction on uneven terrain.
    *   For a utility vehicle or race car on flat ground, use a higher value so the suspension remains stiff and prevents the vehicle from bottoming out.
    *   For a heavy cargo vehicle, dynamically adjust this value to not sag when loaded: Increase strength a bit when full, and lower it again when empty!
    *   For vehicles with more than four wheels, give all _middle_ suspensions a lower strength, so they don't lift the outer wheels off the ground!
*   **Height offset** in centimetres -- The absolute vertical position of the wheel relative to the suspension.
    *   For an all-terrain vehicle, you want high clearance, so use a low wheel position from 0 to -32cm.
    *   For racecars or small utility vehicles, you want to be close to the ground, so you choose a high wheel position from 0 to +32cm.
*   **Friction** in percent -- How much traction (grip) the wheels have on the ground.
    *   Increase this value temporarily while going straight uphill or downhill to get grip, at the cost of turnability.
    *   Decrease this value slightly to be able to turn more smoothly.
    *   For "race drifting" on flat ground, or when using Overrides, or when you want to use (gyroscopic) mouse steering, lower wheel friction to have less turning resistance against the ground.
*   **Speed Limit** in km/h -- Helps you to not actively accelerate above the chosen value.
    *   For slow all-terrain and small utility vehicles, impose a low speed to prevent them from flipping.
    *   For race cars on flat ground, allow higher speeds.
    *   The vehicle can still exceed this speed when racing downhill, it's not a hard limit.
*   **Propulsion Override** in +/- percent -- Used for [Autopiloted](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Autopilot "Autopilot") vehicles or for cruise control. Use a Timer Block to enable the Autopilot and its Overrides together.
*   **Steer Override** in +/- percent -- Used for [Autopiloted](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Autopilot "Autopilot") vehicles or for cruise control. Use a Timer Block to enable the Autopilot and its Overrides together.
