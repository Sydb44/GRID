# Lost Colony Scenario - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/Lost_Colony.png?a41077)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Lost_Colony.png)

Welcome... to Sunset Valley

The Lost Colony scenario is one of the [default scenarios](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") in Space Engineers, created by community member Smokki (Mikko SaarijÃ¤rvi) for Keen. It features a non-linear narrative that the player(s) can follow to discover the secrets of the world.

Up to four people can play this exploration scenario cooperatively [online](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer"). The total playtime (including exploring, gathering, mining, refining, assembling, and welding) is around 12-16 hours solo.

This scenario is only available for PC.

## Should I play it?

There is no handholding for beginners, but the mission steps and objective locations are clearly marked. It could be played in a group of up to four with mixed experience levels.

This exploration-focused scenario expects cooperative players to be able to drive rovers, orientate themselves, avoid defensive systems, manage an inventory, and repair (weld) grids. Own creative building is allowed but not needed nor required.

## Premise

Contact has been lost with a remote colony and its your job to find out what happened. With up to four players, embark on an exciting journey through a settlement, caves and bunkers. Explore the valley and its history by reading the 96 data pads left behind by the colonists. Data pads and useful items can be found in the lockers and containers all around the map.

## Tips (minor spoilers)

After arriving at the first location marked on your first datapad (the old prospector camp) you are free to explore at your own pace. If you feel lost, head for the large Sunset Valley safezone, as the numerous datapads found there will get you oriented and help you locate ores, materials, buildings, and caves.

It is useful to grind down every container after you loot it in order to know which one you have already searched. Gather and use the salvaged components for the main objective.

Also, leave every door open after you search a room, to know where you've been already, or else you will loose track of places really fast. Especially inside safe zones, you cannot leave any other marker (apart from [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") which will clutter your screen).

Your ammunition is limited. It is your only way of disabling the automatic defences guarding certain areas.

## Plot: Warning! Spoilers Ahead!

The player arrives on the planet after a distress call by an [Argonaut Industries (AGI)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Argonaut_Industries "Argonaut Industries") liaison Hiroko Zhang was received from the Sunset Valley colony, housing 60 colonists. After finding the prospector camp empty and no sign of Zhang, the player starts exploring the nearby town, finding numerous sections on emergency lockdown and the nuclear reactor and communications tower sabotaged.

Using the equipment found at the surrounding locations and mines, the player repairs the reactor, while slowly discovering the city-wide corruption and the fate of every colonist from data pad entries along the way. Apparently every citizen slowly started to experience memory loss and eventally lost their sense of preforming basic routines such as eating.

After the players repair the reactor, the lockdown is lifted, finally granting the players access to the Zhang residence and the morgue. A data pad reveals the location of a hidden [R.O.S.](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") comm bunker and eventually two other R.O.S. facilities.

It is revealed that decades before the start of the story, Sunset Valley was inhabited by the [Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") faction who built numerous bunkers and research facilites in the valley. They discovered a cavern containing an unknown fungus that eventually broke free, resulting in a complete lockdown of the research facility. At the same time, the R.O.S. fleet was defeated by an unknown opposing faction (possibly [AGI](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Argonaut_Industries "Argonaut Industries")?) and due to the surface bombardment, most facilities became buried under rubble and were forgotten, with the final survivors succumbing to the fungus in the buried research facility.

Years later, [AGI](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Argonaut_Industries "Argonaut Industries") built a colony in the valley, using an old bunker as the sewer system for their main settlement. However, the Zhangs were secretly tasked with locating the old R.O.S. facilities to track down a "biological agent", eventually repeating history. The fungus started spreading in the colony again, at first leading to people disappearing and dying by themselves. When panic erupted, the colonists destroyed all radio equipment and sabotaged the reactor in an attempt to contain the fungus in the valley and use the reactors radiation to destroy it. Sadly, everyone got infected and eventually died. One distress call however made it through, prompting the player to discover the truth about the colony's fate.

The final datapad that can be found contains the last words of R.O.S. Scientist Dr Saarijarvi:

> "If anyone finds this, I hope the journey was worth it. But I must ask you: Whoever you are, were you even ordered to go as far as to opening this place? Or did you forget your orders along the way?
> 
> If so, I'm sorry to tell you that this is the end for you, as it was for me. Maybe you will go on a bit longer and try to find something more to do, but eventually you will find a nice cozy place to take a break and become one with the valley.
> 
> Dr Saarijarvi signing off."

Finding this message means you have solved the mystery.
