To empty the Welder's inventory:

1.  Connect to the base and open the [Inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") screen.
2.  Filter the left side to show the welder inventory.
3.  Filter the right side to show component containers.
4.  Press the **Deposit All** button.

### How to build and repair fast and in bulk

Several conveyored Welders with overlapping areas of effect are called Welder Wall or Welder Pit. For example, fly small ships with self-[Projectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") slowly past the welders to repair them quickly.

Also look into [3D Printers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/3D_Printer "3D Printer") for grid mass-production.

### Welder Usage Ideas

*   Purposefully Welders hidden under e.g. catwalks can be part of lethal player traps.

*   Constructor ships are equipped with Welder blocks and possibly Grinder blocks together with cargo containers. Their use speeds up welding large projected grids in Survival Mode.

*   Temporary assistance: While building a new base, build a temporary Welder Block on any conveyor [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") next to large unwelded blocks (like Assemblers, Refiners, Jump Drives), and in short time, the Welder will draw components and weld the blocks in its range. Then grind the Welder down and rebuild it on another conveyor port at the next construction site, and so on.

*   A self-[Projector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Projector "Projector") combined with strategically placed internal welders makes an internal self-repair system for any ship, but especially battle ships.

*   A welder "hand" on an [articulated "arm"](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Custom_Turret_Controller "Custom Turret Controller") of [Mechanical Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") and conveyors attached to a conveyor system can be used as a repair crane, for example, in a hangar or on a landing pad.

### Troubleshooting

*   If the welder tip gets stuck in newly built blocks, cover the welder tip with a 3x3 window or a catwalk floor. The welder's area of effect can go through these blocks, but projected blocks will start to be built only where they don't collide with the covering block.

*   If your welder stops welding a large project for "no reason", check whether you have exceeded your [PCU](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PCU "PCU") limit. Many [multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") servers also limit the use of welders per player for performance reasons, so don't just spam them, better share welders with a faction.

*   If right from the start, the welder does not pull in materials, check all conveyors for completeness, including the not very visible piston/hinge/rotor _heads_.

## Range

Range of effect of the welder is 3 small blocks (1.5 m) on small ships and 4 small blocks (2.0m) on a large ships and stations. The range is spherical and centered roughly on the welding tip.

## Power

The Welder requires 2 kW of power while running, regardless of the ship or station it is attached to. It uses the same power whether it has work to do or not.

## Inventory

The Welder has an inventory with a capacity of 3,375 L on small ships and 15,625 L on large ships. The inventory will only accept [component](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component") items.

If attached to a [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") the block will pull items that it needs for a job from the network. On small ships, consider that many components can only be conveyored via _large_ conveyor ports and tubes.

## Construction

The Welder Block exists for large and small grid. It's quite unwieldy as it takes up 2x1x1 blocks space on large ships and 6x3x3 blocks space on small ships. It has mount points on the five sides of its cubic back half. Leave space in front and next to the Welder Block's tip for the area of effect.

It has a large conveyor port on the backside and a small internal inventory. Optimally, you connect it to a conveyor system or cargo containers to store components.
