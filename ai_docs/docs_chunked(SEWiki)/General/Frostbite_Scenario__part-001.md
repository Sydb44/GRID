# Frostbite Scenario - Official Space Engineers Wiki

[![Frostbite splash](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Frostbite.png/320px-Frostbite.png?480b51)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Frostbite.png)

Welcome to drones, snowstorms, and death

This scenario is a [DLC that can be purchased.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1241550/Space_Engineers__Frostbite/) It includes an investigative storyline with spoken voice-overs (in English) by fellow community members.

## Content

In this challenging [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario"), you are a member of a salvage crew which has been tasked by a mysterious client to acquire four extremely valuable data containers on the snowy planet [Triton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Triton "Triton").

Play solo or with [up to four players in online mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer")! Explore this moon's frigid landscape and remarkable architecture, fight off drones, and overcome numerous engineering challenges as you uncover this world's secrets.

## Should I play it?

There is no handholding for beginners, but the mission steps and objective locations are clearly marked. This scenario expects players to be able to repair and improve grids, grind or drill through obstacles, quickly defend themselves with rifles and turrets, and drive rovers under difficult conditions. It is recommended for groups of intermediate or advanced players, since it will be quite hard to complete solo.

## Task summary

You are tasked by your client to retrieve four data containers from the [Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Results_Oriented_Sciences_\(R.O.S.\) "Results Oriented Sciences (R.O.S.)") base on Triton, the content of which exceeds your pay-grade. Contact has been lost with the facilities and it is your task to investigate and retrieve the containers. You are also tasked with retrieving seven ID cards of (presumably dead) employees and learn their fates.

Read all [Data Pads](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Data_Pads "Data Pads") and make sure to save all [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") markers that you discover in them. Loot the lockers and large and small containers all around the map for spare parts and info. It is useful to grind down every container after you loot it in order to know which one you have already looted.

Unlike in the [Lost Colony Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lost_Colony_Scenario "Lost Colony Scenario"), the inventory of the dead engineers can be accessed and additional data pads and tools can be found there as well. You will loose track of places really fast, so mark you way in order to know where you've been already, for example, leave every door open after you search a room.

Gather all ammo, and hack and repair turrets and missile turrets at each site on your way (and even build your own), and find ways to call in helpful drones, as frequent drone strikes will soon pose a constant threat to you and the buildings around you. Your ammunition is limited, and rifles are your only way of disabling turrets and interior turrets guarding certain areas.

There are steep hills and valleys on Triton, but jetpacks are disabled. The [weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather") on Triton consists of frequent storms, severely reducing view distance. Do not leave your vehicle out of view, as you will easily lose sense of direction and location of it.

## Walkthrough (Spoilers)

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

You arrive on the surface of Triton, where you find buildings abandoned and all personnel dead. You find a voice message mentioning frequent drone attacks and that the tunnel leading to the underground research facility has collapsed, trapping everyone inside.

After retrieving supplies from the nearby storages, you come to a fork in the road where you can choose to go down to the Old Mining base or up to the Weather Station.

### Weather Station

Go up to explore the Weather Station ontop Mount Frostbite. Be prepared to deal with drones and the thin atmosphere. Beyond the brittle bridge, note the module that looks like a large merge block with a timer block.

### The Old Mining Base

Back down at the fork, investigate further and head towards **the old mining base**, past a vehicle garage with a caved-in tunnel in the back. Survive a variety of drone attacks and severe weather conditions on the way.

Click to view spoiler

There is a disabled drone on the way to the Old Mining Base which you can repair and it dives at an antenna base nearby which disables one set of spawning drones. At the Old Mining Base, there are also helpful drones that you can keep repaired to assist you.

A friendly Mule drone at the Mining Base can be sent to ferry players quickly between the _Landing Site_ and the _Old Mining Base_, which is helpful if a player has to respawn at the Landing Site.

Repair the mining rover and drive it to the abandoned mine entrance where you grind down the entrance barricade.

### Blocked Tunnel

Use the miner to dig your way through from the _Blocked Tunnel_ marker to the Research Facility. Watch out for interior turrets, defense drones, and gas leaks while you approach the Triton Research Facility Gate.

### Triton Research Facility

Search the **Triton Research Facility** for clues (several voice messages and displays) regarding the whereabouts of the missing containers. Inside the Facility, gather medical components and parts to repair the medical room as safe respawn point. As usual, watch out for interior defenses.

You find the research facility under lockdown, with one data container in the **Manufacturing Line** and three moved to the _Research Archives_. There is a sneaky staircase behind the control station overlooking the manufacturing line on the top floor to access it and open the door. The containers look like large Timer blocks with a Battery. Use a crane that can be steered from Manufacturing Line Controls panel. After retrieving the container from the manufacturing line, you use another button panel to lift the cargo bay lockdown and open the gate, where you can use a forklift to transport the first data container to the elevator.
