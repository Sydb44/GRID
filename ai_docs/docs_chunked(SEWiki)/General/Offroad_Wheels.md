Offroad Wheels are a decorative variant that exists for all wheel blocks and all suspensions. To be able to build offroad wheels, you need to purchase the [Wasteland Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wasteland_Pack "Wasteland Pack").

The Offroad Wheels have the same functionality, mass, and material costs as the equivalent vanilla wheels. The only difference is visual: They look like they are made of a porous, modern material that provides the bounciness of an air filled tyre and avoids the risk of being punctured.

## Trivia

In real life, NASA is similarly experimenting with [puncture-proof wheels](https://www3.nasa.gov/specials/wheels/).

In the game files, the full wheels and suspension blocks are called "racing" wheels, and only the short variants are called "offroad".
