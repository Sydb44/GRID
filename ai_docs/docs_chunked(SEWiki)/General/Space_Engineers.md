Space engineers is a hard science-fiction sandbox game set in a [star system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Star_System "Star System") where you [build](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") space ships, space stations, aircraft, rovers, and [mechs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker") -- everything from small speedy fighter drones to your own Death Star.

Players mine [asteroids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid"), land on [planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets"), salvage wrecks, trade with NPC outposts, and fend off [space pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates"), or become pirates themselves.

The game has two modes, [creative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") and [survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"): In creative, players are able to build without worrying about resources; in survival, players must mine and refine materials, and build ships out of components. Either mode can be played as singleplayer or [multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer").
