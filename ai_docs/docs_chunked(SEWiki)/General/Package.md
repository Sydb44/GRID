The package is an uncraftable item that is part of the [Contracts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Contracts "Contracts") mechanic.

## Usage

When accepting hauling contracts, a symbolic "package" item will appear in your inventory. It is suitable to transport in the player inventory even without a ship's cargo hold. To complete the hauling contract and get your collateral back, deliver the package safely to its destination.

Outside of the contract, the item is worthless to players.
