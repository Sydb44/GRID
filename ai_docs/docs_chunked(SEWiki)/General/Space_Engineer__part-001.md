The **Space Engineer** is the representation or avatar of you, the player, and the player's way of interacting with the game environment.

If you want to roleplay with a background story, you may be interested in the Engineer's [Lore](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Lore "Lore") - or just make up your own!

## Character Properties

You use [Keyboard and Mouse](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), or [Xbox Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Xbox_Controls "Xbox Controls")/[PlayStation Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/PlayStation_Controls "PlayStation Controls") to walk, pilot ships, and interact.

Space Engineers can:

*   equip [tools](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool "Tool") to create or break [blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block") or to mine [ores](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ores "Ores"), or wield [Character Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Weapons "Character Weapons") to fight.
*   place blocks and build spaceships, stations, or vehicles.
*   carry items in their [backpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") and [trade](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Trading "Player Trading").
*   drive rovers and pilot ships.
*   push small grids.

Additionally, engineers can express themselves in multiplayer through [emotes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Emotes "Emotes") and [chat](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Chat "Chat").

## Space Suit Properties

Spacesuit seen from the side

The engineers suit is equipped with:

*   [Antenna](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna")
*   [Life Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support") (power, oxygen)
*   [Magnetic Boots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Boots "Magnetic Boots")
*   [Jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") (hydrogen)

The suit antenna has a range of only 200 metres:

*   The engineer can [remotely access](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Access_Screen "Remote Access Screen") shared grids that are within a 200m radius.
*   The engineer can passively see other antennas that have a stronger broadcast radius, but cannot actively connect to them.

If you e.g. want to [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") a drone, do it seated and use a base or ship antenna, don't rely on your suit antenna for more than short range.

## Appearance

Space Engineers avatar - default female and male faces

The Engineer will start in a spacesuit with a random color. Standard starting colors are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, and Black.

You can change your suit appearance by opening the [Character Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Character_Screen "Character Screen") or in-game at a [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room").

## Player Vitality

Vitality is determined by three [Life Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support") factors: Health, Suit Energy, and [Oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen").

You recharge these three properties by interacting with a [powered](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power") and conveyored [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") or [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_kit "Survival kit").

*   Suit energy can also be regenerated by sitting in a [Cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") or Passenger Seat or Control Seat in a powered [grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid"), but this will not regenerate health.
*   A [Cryo Chamber](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cryo_Chamber "Cryo Chamber") restores oxygen and hydrogen if it is conveyored to respective tanks or generators, but does not restore health, either.

Health can be negatively impacted by [discharges from weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") such as handguns, rifles, automatic turrets, and rocket launchers. Tools like the [Welder](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder "Welder") and [Grinder](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder "Grinder"), if used on other players, double as melee weapons or traps. High speed collisions with the ground, asteroids, other players, and grids are another source of often [lethal damage](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death").

The player can survive without a helmet in a warm and oxygenated environment, such as a [pressurized](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") room or the [Earthlike](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Earth_Planet "Earth Planet") planet. Outside an atmosphere, players slowly suffocate if they run out of oxygen or open their helmets. In space, on moons, and on extreme planets, suit energy is continuously consumed to maintain a suitable [environment](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Environment "Category:Environment") for the engineer.

Using tools such as the hand drill, welder, and grinder, increases power consumption, causing the suit to run out of energy at an increased rate. The [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") warns you in red text once the suit reaches critical levels of 20% or less, providing the player with time to find a Cockpit or Medical Room to recharge [Life Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support"). If the suit power reaches 0%, the player's handheld tools and life support will no longer function!

Once health reaches 0%, players are considered [dead](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death"); they drop their backpack and are prompted to respawn. You can force your character to respawn without inventory by pressing [BACKSPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

You respawn at the closest faction-owned (or your own, if factionless) [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit") or [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room"). Depending on the auto-respawn [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), you may instead be allowed to pick a respawn point from a list.
