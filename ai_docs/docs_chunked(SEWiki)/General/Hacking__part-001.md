Getting illegal access to a cockpit using grinder and welder (hacking mechanic)

Hacking is a game mechanic that transfers [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") of a functional block from players or NPCs to the hacker. Ownership controls who can use a block in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode").

Hacking is used in situations where you can’t use the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") to transfer ownership legally, typically due to piracy. In short, you “hack” a functional block by [grinding](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_\(Tool\) "Grinder (Tool)") away all of its [Computer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Computer "Computer") parts, and then [rewelding](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_\(Tool\) "Welder (Tool)") the block.

## Why do I need hacking?

When capturing a ship or station owned by players or NPCs of an enemy faction, you will be unable to open doors, to access cargo containers, to take the ammo out of turrets, to use the cockpit, to change thruster or gyro settings, and so on. Also, NPC ships will despawn unless you [claim ownership of them](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Claim_NPC_Ship "Claim NPC Ship"). To be able to interact with pirated blocks and ships (beyond destruction), you need to hack them.

## How to gain ownership of a block?

The grinder tooltip in the HUD showing the functional line and the hacked line of a block (left side). Components marked in red (right side) cannot be salvaged with a grinder.

To gain ownership of a functional block:

1.  Grind the block with a handheld [Grinder (Tool)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_\(Tool\) "Grinder (Tool)") until you disassemble the computer parts.
2.  Keep an eye on the tooltip on the [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD"), it shows your hacking progress!
    *   On the right side, the blue horizontal marker indicates the functional line. Components above the marker are optional and only provide armor. When a block is grinded (or damaged) "below the functional line", it stops functioning.
    *   On the right side, the red horizontal line indicates when the block is "hacked". When you have disassembled all  [![Icon Item Computer.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/72/Icon_Item_Computer.png/21px-Icon_Item_Computer.png?65c1a4)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Computer "Computer") [Computer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Computer "Computer") components, it loses its original ownership.
3.  Be careful not to grind any components that grind to scrap, they are highlighted with red text. You will have to assemble new ones to weld the block up again.
4.  Use a handheld [Welder (Tool)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_\(Tool\) "Welder (Tool)") to weld the  [![Icon Item Computer.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/72/Icon_Item_Computer.png/21px-Icon_Item_Computer.png?65c1a4)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Computer "Computer") [Computer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Computer "Computer") back in to gain ownership.
5.  Use a handheld [Welder (Tool)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_\(Tool\) "Welder (Tool)") to weld the other components "above the functional line" so the block becomes functional again.

Did you know? Welding up the  [![Icon Item Computer.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/72/Icon_Item_Computer.png/21px-Icon_Item_Computer.png?65c1a4)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Computer "Computer") [Computer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Computer "Computer")s is the act that assigns [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") to the hacking player.

## How to claim an NPC ship before it despawns?

[![](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/a/af/Claim-npc-grid.png/320px-Claim-npc-grid.png?466132)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Claim-npc-grid.png)

Hacking only gives you access to that one block. What about the whole NPC ship, how do you transfer ownership to yourself after hacking the blocks?

You need to [claim the NPC ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Claim_NPC_Ship "Claim NPC Ship"), not only hack the blocks.

## Is hacking “illegal”?

Stealing other players' blocks is a PvP move. The game does not punish players for hacking; there is no built-in NPC police force. Hacking blocks belonging to a faction (including NPC factions) will lower your reputation with them.

## What can be hacked?

Decorative blocks and armor cannot be hacked nor owned. Only functional blocks and grids have [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") and can be hacked. Hackers transfer grid ownership to themselves on the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") after all functional blocks have been hacked.

### Can I hack Prototech Blocks?

Hacking Prototech blocks is the same:

1.  Point your grinder at the block and note the components highlighted in red in the tooltip - don't grind those components, they will turn into [scrap](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech_Scrap "Prototech Scrap").
2.  Note that the [Prototech Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech_Panel "Prototech Panel") are _not_ red and can be grinded and will be placed in your inventory (just be careful that your inventory is not full).
3.  Proceed to grind down all components including the computers to the hack line.
4.  Re-weld everything, as usual.
