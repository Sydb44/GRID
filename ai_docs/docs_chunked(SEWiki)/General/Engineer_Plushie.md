rare component

The Engineer Plushie is a decorative block for small grid. At the same time, it is also a non-craftable [Component](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component").

## Usage

This block is "An advanced motivational device of pristine quality." For a block with similar usage, see [Saberoid Plushie](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Saberoid_Plushie "Saberoid Plushie").

## Port size

On small [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid"), Engineer Plushies fit through small [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port").

## Construction

You need the _plushie component_ in your inventory, and the _plushie block_ selected in your [G-Menu](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar"). Note: The plushie component cannot be crafted in an Assembler, only found or traded.

1.  Press [G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Tool Bar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") Config.
2.  Select the plushie block and add it to your toolbar.
3.  Make sure you have the plushie component in your inventory.
4.  Select the toolbar slot and LMB click to place the plushie block.

The block is [colorable](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Color "Color") but cannot have armor skins. It has one mount point on the bottom.

## Free standing plushie

Do not place down a plushie block free standing (for example, as a 'display' on a large grid desk block). This will create 2 issues.

*   First, the block will be considered by the game as a 'trash' and will be subject to trash removal (i.e. it will despawn if you move away more than a few hundred meters).
*   Second, on a dynamic grid (ex: on a ship), this block will be free floating, and become a hazard while maneuvering the ship, possibly damaging surrounding blocks, destroying itself in the process, hitting/injuring a passenger, and being left behind while initiating a jump.

To avoid those issues, plushies can be attached to a small grid block, or as a sub-grid using large to small grid rotor trick.

## Trivia

This block is based on the real-life [Engineer Plushie](https://www.makeship.com/products/space-engineers-plush) plushie which is based on the [player character](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineer "Space Engineer").

*   In Survival Mode, the plushie block cannot be built from components.
*   In Survival Mode, the plushie component cannot be assembled from materials nor disassembled into materials. When you grind a built plushie block down, you get the plushie component back.
*   In Creative Mode, you can place the plushie block from the [G menu](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar").
*   [Admins can spawn in](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spawn_Menu "Spawn Menu") the plushie component for others to place.
