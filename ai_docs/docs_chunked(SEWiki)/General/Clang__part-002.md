## The Heart of Klang

There is a rare bug on atmospheric planets where small bushes --usually anchored to the ground and gently waving in the breeze-- are anchored within themselves near ground level, and they appear as a spherical pulsating immaterial blob that cannot be removed. The indestructable pulsating nature has given this bug the nickname Heart of Clang or Eye of Klang etc.

## Clang Sparks

The game's [Damage Mechanics](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Mechanics "Damage Mechanics") are often accompanied by scaled-up visual effects, one of them is Clang Sparks.

When you first saw Clang, were you blinded by its majesty?

## Clang Drive

A clang drive is an esoteric kind of spaceship propulsion. It's a reproducible exploit using the unintended side-effects of game physics to accellerate and steer the spaceship, instead of using thrusters. E.g. you mash a piston into another block and it moves the ship for free.

## Official Mentions by Keen in Game

*   The key labels on the [Helm](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helm "Helm") keyboard spell out Clang.

*   One of the [Warning Signs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warning_Signs "Warning Signs") says "0 days since the last Clang accident."

## Cause and Explanation

Clanging has been greatly reduced after update 1.196 which fixed oversized hitboxes and gracefully granted the current generation of engineers (slightly) more adventurous [mechanical](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") builds.

Clanging is caused by the collision boxes of a subgrid intersecting the collision boxes of another grid. In a more realistic setting, that would cause the grids to be damaged. But by default, [subgrid damage is switched off](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), so a subgrid can't be damaged by its parent grid, so instead it starts shaking to avoid taking up the same space.

In general, you want to enable "Share Inertial Tensor" on the hinges/pistons/rotors that are not directly attached to the main grid. So, in the case of a crane arm/drill arm that has a rotor, hinge, and then pistons, with the rotor attached to the ship, you'd turn Share Inertial Tensor on for the hinge and pistons, but not the rotor. If you turned it on for the rotor as well, then every time you tried to move the crane arm, you'd be trying to move the mass of the entire ship. And in space, that causes the ship itself to move erratically.[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)
