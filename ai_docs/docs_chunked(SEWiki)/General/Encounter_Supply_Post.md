The Encounter Supply Post is a small building that is part of the [Planetary Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planetary_Encounters "Planetary Encounters"). From ~5km away, you will see a white signal "Supply Post" owned by one of the NPC factions.

## Description

When you approach, the base detects approaching players and switches its Security Systems Active. The base is elevated and surrounded by featureless walls like a bunker. There is one staircase to get up and landing platform for deliveries, similar to other such bases. If you attack it, you will lose standing with one of the NPC factions.

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

## Defenses

This low-security base only starts defending itself in the moment when you start breaking in (after you start damaging blocks or pushing buttons). It can be easily defeated by taking out one small gatling turret on the platform.

## Loot

There are few cargo containers and freight boxes visible though the windows. Loot contains for example:

*   Basic Assembler
*   Prototech panels or similar
*   Thousands of Ores
*   Some Components
*   Datapads with lore
