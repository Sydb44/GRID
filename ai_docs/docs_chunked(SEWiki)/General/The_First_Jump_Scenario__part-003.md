| --- | --- |Mission 3: the Ruined Camp
| Story | Learn how to... |
| Setting: A ruined camp on the Earthlike planet  <br>Cutscene: During the flight, you hear that your new allies, ITW, are settlers who took on a contract with the ROS corporation. ROS then unscrupulously attacked the ITW settlement to leave no witnesses of the artefact's discovery. The settlers are in possession of a broken frigate and a de-powered base. They need an engineer --you-- to help them repair, so they can take revenge. |     |
| You exit the drop ship, which then leaves. In the ITW settlement, you see tents, and a garage with a rover, a broken solar panel and a misaligned solarpanel. The camp is riddled with craters and holes. Broken thrusters, molten reactors, and burning decoys all strewn about. Your suit AI points out the repairs needed (solar panels) and containers with spare parts. |     |
| Optional: In one of the tents you find a button that loads a log message on the screen that describes how the ITW settlers had to flee from an attacking ROS fleet after completing their excavation contract.<br><br>Optional: At the edge of the base you find a broken small ship and a dead body with a log message on a display next to him. This settler returned to rescue survivors and was killed by a swarm of ROS drones.<br><br>Optional: You also find a grinder pit with a sign warning that it is not to be used. Downstairs, when you push a button, the grinder starts chasing you around. You can hide under floorboards and escape through stairs. | (Optional exploration.) |
| In one tent, you find spare parts. You may need to go back and fetch more spare parts if they did not fit in your inventory. After the battery is built, it kickstarts the solar panels to align properly again, and restores power. | Take components from the container ([I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Add the block to your toolbar ([G key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Click to place the block at the marked location. Select the welder as your Character Tool (press a number key). (If the tutorial does not proceed, try holding another welder instead.) Click to weld up the block with the spare parts in your inventory and welder in hand. |
| Use the elevator to enter the ITW camp's hangar. Downstairs, you see the damaged frigate. Follow the marker to the control station. Upstairs, you find the ITW chief engineer's log, who says he has completed all repairs except for the last thruster. You push the button in the control station and find out that the frigate also needs fuel (uranium) from a highlighted container. Then take the uranium to the frigate and place it into the highlighted reactor. | Refuel a reactor ([I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Pick up ([F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")) hydrogen bottles in case your jetpack runs out. |
| Follow the markers to fetch a grinder and put it on your toolbar to use it. Use the grinder to salvage components from the marked wrecked thruster, then weld the marked frigate thruster to repair it.  <br>Follow the markers to the hydrogen tanks and push the buttons to refuel, then push the button to disconnect the fuel line again.  <br>Finally, you return upstairs to the control station and push the button to open the roof hangar doors. You return to the frigate and sit in the flight seat and fly up towards the highlighted rendevous point. | Press number keys to switch tools and click to salvage (grind) and repair (weld). Refuel hydrogen. Toggle between 1st and 3rd person view ([V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Lift off in a frigate (press [SPACE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). |
| Cutscene: You join the ITW (yellow) faction's attack on the ROS (red) faction's frigate. You use the button to control one of the rocket launchers and shoot at the highlighted weak points on the red frigate. You did it! You helped the settlers, and the evil corporation retreats! For now. |     |

| --- | --- |Mission 4: Final confrontation
| Story | Learn how to... |
| Setting: Mars  <br>You come to inside your crashed frigate. Reactor meltdown is imminent and you exit the frigate quickly before it explodes. You look up and in the sky, you see the Earthlike planet and its moon far away. You are in the Mars desert. |     |
| Your allies send you coordinates to a Landing Zone nearby, where a yellow Rebel Atmo Frigate passes and drops supplies: A cargo container with a weapon and ammo, and a tank-like vehicle with gatlings and rocket launchers. | Enter the land vehicle [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). |
| Cutscene: Ahead lies the battle ground, past crashed yellow and red ships, there is the red base, ROS-4, hidden in the side of a Mars mountain. |     |
| You drive forwards and shoot down all attacking red fleetâ€™s rovers and ships, and also the defenses on the base. Don't shoot down the yellow fleet's ship. Drive up to the gate and use the rocket launcher to breach it. | Unlock the handbrake ([P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")). Drive with WASD keys. You can press [V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to change your point of view. Press numbered toolbar slots to enter turret control, [![Left](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png?c1a406)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left")\-click to shoot, press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to exit turret control.  <br>Tip: Hold [![Right](https://commons.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png/20px-Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png?3581de)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") to use [Target Locking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Target_Locking "Target Locking")! |
| If your tank is destroyed, you choose the next-best option: Go to one of the marked "usable ship wreckages", follow the green arrows to sit in a control seat inside, and control the wreck's rocket launchers/turrets to destroy the gate. | Turret control tutorial, continued. |
| When it's save to approach the base (there is no prompt), enter through the breached gate and go deeper into the base. Roadblocks stop your tank, so you proceed on foot through a long hangar with offline drones and locked cargo containers. The drone factory lies just ahead.  <br>The AI detects strange signals and assumes the artefact is close--as is the CEO of the R.O.S. corporation, who is "not happy" with you. You use the marked Door Control button to open the door to the factory. |     |
