Damaged Dyad SPRT heavy drone, circa March 2017

The Dyad is a heavy drone send by the [Argentavis](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Argentavis "Argentavis") to punish its victims. It is plated with heavy armor blocks and contains a missile and Gatling turret.

Defeating this drone used to be mildly painful in the older versions of the game, however, after [Update 1.200 - Warfare 2: Broadside](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Version_History "Version History"), this battle has gotten significantly easier: Several well-aimed [Artillery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artillery "Artillery") shells will entirely incapitate the drone, sometimes even one will be sufficient. Aim at the central section.
