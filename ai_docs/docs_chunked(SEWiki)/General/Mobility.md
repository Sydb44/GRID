# Category:Mobility - Official Space Engineers Wiki

This category is an overview of blocks that are essential for [building](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") mobile [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") such as space ships and rovers. Your player mobility depends on the [Jetpack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") and [Magnetic Boots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Boots "Magnetic Boots").

## Essential mobility blocks

*   [Cockpits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") give you movement control (on PC: using the WASD and Space/C keys)
*   [Gyroscopes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") give you pitch, roll, yaw control (on PC: using the mouse and Q/E keys)
*   Specialised blocks for different environments:
    *   Flyers need [thrust](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster "Thruster") in all six directions
        *   Atmospheric thrusters for airplanes
        *   Ion thrusters for spaceships
        *   Hydrogen thrusters for hybrid shuttles and as boosters
    *   Vehicles (race cars, trucks, tanks, rovers...) use [wheels and suspensions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension "Wheel Suspension")
    *   [Mechas](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker") use [mechanical legs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") to walk

## How to stabilise mobile grids

  
To prevent flipping planetary vehicles and walkers, keep the CoM low and the wheelbase wide and symmetric. You can lower the CoM by placing heavy blocks (gyroscopes, batteries, cargo containers) low, between the wheels.

To learn how to use the zero-RPM override for stabilisation, see [Gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope").

It's easier to stabilise spaceships: Even with asymmetric thruster placement, the game automatically prevents tailspinning because it applies thrust and rotation to the [Center of Mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Center_of_Mass "Center of Mass"). To make gyroscope rotation in zero gravity feel more intuitive, keep the CoM and the main cockpit close to each other.
