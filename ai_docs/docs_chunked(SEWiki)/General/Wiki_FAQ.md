## Wiki FAQ

## Why another wiki?

In short: because Fandom Inc is a dumpster fire, and no-one can update spaceengineerswiki.com.

## This wiki says it's official, but so does spaceengineerswiki.com?

Spaceengineerswiki.com has been abandoned for a long time. New user registrations are broken, and attempts to get in touch with the owner have so far failed. It's also badly out of date.

The admin of the Fandom wiki, AdaRynin, met community manager Kienata at a [Keen Software House](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Keen_Software_House "Keen Software House") open day in 2023. In context with community feelings towards Fandom.com, Kienata agreed to initiate contact with wiki.gg and granted wiki.gg 'Official' status. For example, [Marek's Blog from May 2024](https://blog.marekrosa.org/2024/05/space-engineers-signal.html) mentions wiki.gg.

## What about the Fandom wiki?

Don't use the outdated fandom.com wiki, [Fandom.com is facing some controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fandom_\(website\)&oldid=1225621536#Controversies).

## What are these other smaller wikis?

In no particular order (if any are missing, please add them):

*   [Keen's ModAPI](https://keensoftwarehouse.github.io/SpaceEngineersModAPI/)
*   [Malware's MDK Wiki](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/wiki) - largely transferred here already
*   [SEUT reference](https://semref.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/tools/pages/4293178/About)
