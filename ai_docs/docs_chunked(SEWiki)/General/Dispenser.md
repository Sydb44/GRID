Dispensers are decorative large-grid blocks that sell uncraftable drinks. To build this block, you must have purchased the [Decorative Pack 2](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Decorative_Pack_2 "Decorative Pack 2") DLC, but after being built, the Dispenser can be used by all players that the owner gives permissions to. Dispensers are often found inside NPC [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts").

## Usage

The only things you can buy from a Dispenser are [Clang Cola](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Clang_Cola "Clang Cola") and [Cosmic Coffee](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cosmic_Coffee "Cosmic Coffee"). There is no other way to produce these two Consumables in game.

> "This special vending machine is used to distract engineers from the hazards of space and boost morale."

Dispensers are similar to the [Vending Machine](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Vending_Machine "Vending Machine") (DLC) in that they have a very user-friendly interface that you interact with through buttons in game.

### What can I buy?

1.  Make sure you have more than 100 [space credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits") in your bank account or in your inventory.
2.  Aim at the the up/down buttons with an empty hand and LMB click or press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") until the display shows you the desired offer.
3.  Click the **Shoppingcart** button to buy the displayed item.
    *   If your money was accepted, the screen responds "Thank you for your purchase", and it dispenses the drink can.
    *   If you do not have enough money, the screen says "Insufficienct funds" and nothing is dispensed. Bring money and try again.
4.  Aim at the can on the ground and press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to pick it up.

Dispensers can dispense an unlimited amount of drink cans. The dispensed item is a soda can which is, in gravity, unceremoniously dropped on the ground, whereas in zero g, it gets stuck inside the slot, thus perfectly simulating the behaviour of a drinks dispenser.

### What can I sell?

Nothing. In contrast to [Vending Machines](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Vending_Machine "Vending Machine") and [Stores](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store"), Dispensers only sell predefined goods (the drinks), they have no conveyor ports nor inventory, and players cannot use them to sell their own goods.

## Trivia

In the game files, this block is called FoodDispenser.

## Construction

The block requires a tiny amount of power to operate. It needs 1x1x1 large grid blocks to place but only takes up one wall side of that space.
