Vending Machines are large-grid trading blocks that can be used by all players, but can be built only if you purchase the [Economy Deluxe Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Economy_Deluxe_Pack "Economy Deluxe Pack") DLC. Vending Machines can be found, for example, at [trading outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") or in multiplayer bases. An even more simplified variant of the Vending Machine is the [Dispenser](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Dispenser "Dispenser").

## Usage

This block facilitates trading on multiplayer servers where Economy is disabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"). The Vending Machine is a more user-friendly DLC variant of the [Store Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Store "Store") that has a more direct user interface where players push buttons in game.

### How to buy?

Use Vending Machines owned by other players to buy items from them. Vending Machines advertise available offers automatically on their LCD display.

1.  To the right of the display, click the **Up** and **Down** buttons to browse the offers.
2.  Then click the **Shoppingcart** button to buy the currently displayed item.
3.  If you have enough [space credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_credits "Space credits") in your bank account or cash in your inventory, the display will respond "Thank you for your purchase" and the item is deposited in your inventory.

Otherwise, if there was a transaction failure, the display says "Insufficienct funds" (then you need to bring more money) or "Out of stock" (then ask the [owner](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") to refill it), respectively.

### How to sell?

Only a player who has bought the "Economy Deluxe DLC" can build the vending machine block on their grids. And only if you own the Vending Machine block (or your faction or the owner has shared it with you) you can create offers to sell items to other players.

1.  First, make sure you have the [items](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item") that you intend to sell (components, materials, or comsumables) in your player [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory").
2.  Face the display and press [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the Vending Machine's inventory.
3.  Transfer the items into the machine's inventory, then close the window.

*   Select your item type from the list, enter the amount of items that you want to sell as one unit, and specify a sell price per unit -- or accept the default price.  
    Tip: Selling "a unit" means, for example, that you do not intend to sell individual steel plates, but you want to sell them in batches of 100.
*   The block can impose additional listing fees and transaction fees for larger amounts of goods.
*   You can create several offers, and also delete your existing offers on this screen.

Then close the screen. The offer now appears on the Vending Machine's display.

### Configuration Options

Optionally, configure the block: Face the block and press [K key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to open the [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").

*   Decide whether you want to choose "Anyone can use" to let non-faction members and even non-neutrals trade.  
    Tip: Make sure that potential customers can reach the vending machine alive behind your faction's defences.
*   Choose a custom colour for the display.
*   Keep the "Content: Script" and "Script: Vending Machine GUI" setting to ensure that the block will function as a vending machine.

## Inventory

It has an inventory that owners must refill manually by pressing [I key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") on the front display.

## Construction

The block requires power to operate. Unlike the Store Block, the Vending Machine has no [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port"), so you cannot refill the inventory through conveyors.
