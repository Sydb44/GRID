# HUD - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The HUD (Heads-Up Display) inside the engineers helmet displays helpful information, such as player/ship status, [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") markers and radar [signals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Signal "Signal"), [chat](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Chat "Chat") messages, [crosshairs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options"), help tooltips, and [warnings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Warning_Options "Warning Options") on your screen. You toggle the visibility of the HUD by pressing the [TAB key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") which cycles the HUD through full, minimal, and off. Toggling the HUD off is beneficial when taking [screenshots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Screenshots "Screenshots").

## Cycling HUD Visibility

You can cycle your HUD through three states of detail by pressing [TAB key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

1.  First press hides the help tooltips from the HUD.
2.  Second press hides the whole HUD. Useful when taking screenshots.
3.  Third press cycles back to the full HUD with help tooltips.

Tip: To hide or show the crosshair on the HUD, change the setting in the [Options](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Options "Options") window.

    Pressing [TAB key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") once hides the tooltips on the HUD.
    
*   [![Pressing TAB key a second time hides the whole HUD.](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/HUD_hidden.png/120px-HUD_hidden.png?8ba9fd)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:HUD_hidden.png "Pressing TAB key a second time hides the whole HUD.")
    
    Pressing [TAB key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") a second time hides the whole HUD.
    
*   [![To hide or show the crosshair on the HUD, go to the Options window.](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/HUD_Crosshair_option.png/120px-HUD_Crosshair_option.png?70d4d3)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:HUD_Crosshair_option.png "To hide or show the crosshair on the HUD, go to the Options window.")

## Signals and GPS

Signals are the short floating words that appear on your HUD to provide you with additional information about your surroundings, such as the presence of players, bases, vehicles/ships, or ores. Some signals are associated with [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS"), others with [Antennas](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Antenna "Antenna") and [Beacons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Beacon "Beacon").

Press [H key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to cycle your own HUD to either fully show all signals, show minimal signals, or hide all signals. This toggle has no impact on what _other players_ can see.

Players can toggle their suit broadcast on/off by pressing [O key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Other players can only see your signal if you have it toggled on.
