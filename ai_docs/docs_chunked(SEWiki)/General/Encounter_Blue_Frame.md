This wreck we find looks like Swiss Cheese

The original of the Blue Ship wreck

The Blue Frame is a large grid derelict ship that can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is [enabled in your world](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

## Description

The wreck belongs to the "[Space Pirates](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates")"Â faction, and emits the "SPRT MAYDAY" beacon signal. The ship has no defences, and there is a small grid repair ship Constructor Mk.2 attached to the wreck, with some components, but by far not enough to repair the wreck.

The ship is a great starting point if someone is looking for a space repair ship, or wants to recreate the [Blue Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Blue "Big Blue") frame with their own design.

## Original blueprint

The frame is the [Big Blue](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Blue "Big Blue"), one of the oldest ships in the game made by Keen. The scenario we enocunter here could possibly be an abandoned mid-space ship building project -- or the ship was shot full of holes and stripped for parts.

## Properties

*   Block count: 605
*   PCU:2714

## Loot

The Blue Ship frame itself is in a very incomplete state, details of which can vary randomly.

The main loot is a small-grid hydrogen ship, Constructor Mk.2 (formerly Welder Mk.2). It will be missing random parts but is fixable. The Constructor Mk.2 cargo containers hold a few components of value. and the constructor ship itself can be taken over and used by the engineer if desired.
