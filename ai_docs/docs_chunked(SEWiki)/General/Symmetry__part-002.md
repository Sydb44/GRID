Subgrids are the parts of your build that are attached through [Mechanical Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") such as Rotors. When you build complex subgrids with mirror symmetry (such as two rotated nacelles or [walker legs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker") or twin [custom turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Custom_Turret_Controller "Custom Turret Controller")) using Symmetry would be handy — but Symmetry does not work across subgrids.

In this case, use the following workaround (credit to community member BlackArmor):

1.  Build a stalk of temporary armour blocks out from the start of the first subgrid, away from the main grid, to where you have free space.
2.  Then set a mirror plane _in the middle of the stalk_.
3.  While you now continue building the first subgrid, a copy will be mirrored _on the other end of the stalk_.
4.  When you're done with the first subgrid, remove the stalk and cut both subgrid copies free.
5.  Finally, use [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to cut the floating mirror copy, and then [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to paste it onto its own rotor on its own side of the main grid, where you actually wanted it.

How to use Symmetry mode to mirror subgrids (by BlackArmor)

## What are caveats of symmetry mode

Be careful when deleting blocks in Symmetry Mode. It’s possible that the mirrored quadrants are not 100% identical — perhaps because you had forgotten to switch on Symmetry Mode for a few clicks, or because a stray loosely floating block prevented a mirrored block from being placed. Even if deleting the block did not split the grid in the quadrant that you were working on, the grid could split in one of the (accidentally different) mirrored quadrants. For larger builds, remember to check the other quadrants regularly and clean up obstacles such as floating blocks.

For tips how to fix split grids, see [Merge Block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block").

If you are copying station blocks with symmetry planes attached to them and paste them together, multiple sets of the same planes will show for the same station. However, the planes are only active for their original blocks.
