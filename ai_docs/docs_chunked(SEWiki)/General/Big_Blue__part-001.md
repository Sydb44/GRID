# Big Blue - Official Space Engineers Wiki

**Big Blue** also known simply as **Blue Ship** is a [Pre-Built](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Built_Ship "Pre-Built Ship") [Large Grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") Ship that is present along with the [Big Red](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Red "Big Red") ship in several [easy-start type games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Original_Content "Original Content"). It is also formerly known as Blue 2. In game lore, the blue fleet is possibly owned by the [Sol Cooperative](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sol_Cooperative "Sol Cooperative") faction.

## Design

The Big Blue is a long and slender vessel, with a narrow (and fragile) midsection, which makes it weak to ramming attacks.

Although the Big Blue class does feature a hangar in the forward section, it is smaller than that of the Big Red class, and has only two entrances/exits. Using patience and careful maneuvering, a player may be able to fit two of the pre-built [Fighters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Fighter "Fighter") into the hangar. It is worth noting that Big Blue's hangar deck is made of heavy armour blocks, which will limit damage from small ship thruster but the top thrusters of the pre-built fighter often disables a few of the interior lights within the hangar.

Lightly armed and without a  [![Icon Block Refinery.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/6/6a/Icon_Block_Refinery.png/21px-Icon_Block_Refinery.png?a9b68a)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery") [Refinery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery") it is unclear what this vessel was intended for. But with its advanced oxygen systems,  [![Icon Block Medical Room.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/4/42/Icon_Block_Medical_Room.png/21px-Icon_Block_Medical_Room.png?a9d978)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room") and  [![Icon Block Jump Drive.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/a/aa/Icon_Block_Jump_Drive.png/21px-Icon_Block_Jump_Drive.png?c39dc2)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive") [Jump Drive](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jump_Drive "Jump Drive") it can safely be assumed that this was an investigation and exploration vessel. But without a viable form of repair or ore processing, it maybe just a small jump carrier for deep space travel. One theory is that with its small frontal profile that this ship was meant to be a light exploration or asteroid field patrol ship.
