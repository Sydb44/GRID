## What are the item type restrictions?

Certain blocks, such as cargo containers, [Collectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector"), [Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector"), can hold any type item. But some slots are restricted to hold specific kinds of items: For example, refineries accept only raw ores and output only refined ores, assemblers accept only refined ores and output only components, tools, and consumables; weapons only hold ammo and rocket launchers only hold missiles; gas processing devices accept only ice and/or bottles; the parachute hatch only holds [canvas](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Canvas "Canvas"), and so on.

*   [Components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component") and [Consumables](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Consumable "Consumable")
*   [Raw Ores](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ores "Ores")
*   [Refined Ore Ingots](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material")
*   [Uranium fuel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Uranium_Ingot "Uranium Ingot")

## Does player inventory transfer to multiplayer?

Your engineers inventory contents are bound to each save game and not only to the player character. Your character may look the same on each server, but in each game, you have a separate inventory that you cannot transfer to another game.
