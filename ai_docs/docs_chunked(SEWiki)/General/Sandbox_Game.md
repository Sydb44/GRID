# Sandbox Game - Official Space Engineers Wiki

Sandbox games are one category of [New Game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_Game "New Game"). These custom maps have no preset goals — players set their own.

*   You build your own spaceships, rovers, walkers, and stations.
*   You are free to customise the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), add [mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods"), add [planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets"), etc.

You can pick from the following presets:

## Red Ship v2

This [Quickstart](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Quickstart "Quickstart") map is recommended for beginners to explore. Try out various ships (fighters and utility ships), do some mining, use [production](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Production "Production") facilities, weld up damaged ships, trigger sensors and push buttons! Then use what you have learned in a custom sandbox game, such as "Star System".

## Star System / Home System

[Star System / Home System](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Star_System_Home_System "Star System Home System") is the most popular and most commonly used preset for starting adventures in [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode").

*   On PC, the Star System world contains all default [planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets"): Earthlike, Moon, Mars, Alien, Triton, Europa, Titan, Pertam.
*   On consoles, your three options are:
    *   Home System: contains Earthlike, Moon, Mars
    *   Distant Worlds/Alien System: contains Alien planet, Pertam
    *   Distant Moons: contains Europa, Titan, Triton

## Sparks of the Future

Party with friends and explore a futuristic asteroid station in the [Sparks of the Future Scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sparks_of_the_Future_Scenario "Sparks of the Future Scenario")! Try not to get arrested (or hit by a train) while snooping around behind the scenes of shiny casinos, shooting galeries, luxury hotels, and night clubs. This sandbox game contains multiple asteroids and stations, multiple shuttles, and a ship load of entertainment. There are no planets.

This exploration showcase has no objectives and there is no building required, just exploration. You can play it in singleplayer or multiplayer.

## Pertam Orbiter

Spawn in an industrial asteroid base above [Pertam](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pertam "Pertam"). Remotely connect to a rover to analyse the desert base below. Explore the asteroid base to find the best vehicle to take you down to the planet. Pertam Orbiter makes a perfect start point for a Pertam playthrough. No other planets nor objectives are included.

## Asteroid Armory

Play as the red or blue faction, PvP against friends, or go solo and engage in a bit of PvE piracy in this prebuilt conflict zone. This showcase features the upgraded iconic ships [Big Red](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Red "Big Red") and [Big Blue](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Big_Blue "Big Blue") that you can take for a spin. Hunt NPC cargo ships and use the Asteroid Armory as a weapons test platform.

Asteroid belt only, asteroid station, battle ships, NPC ships, no planets.

## Empty World

This map is intended for [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"), serving as a clean canvas to build in zero gravity. The player spawns in an empty world without ships, planets, or stations. Asteroids are generated.

Experienced players use this template in Creative Mode to manually add planets, workshop blueprints, and mods. After adding content, you can choose to switch to Survival Mode to play or create a custom scenario.

If it isn't listed, enable [Experimental mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Experimental_mode "Experimental mode")[\[1\]](#cite_note-1).
