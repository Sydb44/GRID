## Summary (Spoilers!)

You can complete the main tasks in any order, but travel time and distance are also a factor.

| Location Name | Available Systems | Tasks | Loot | Tips |
| Platform (Start) | Survival Kit, O2/H2 Generator, Solar Panels | Refill health and bottles, repair damaged power and conveyor system, mine ore, refill generator with ice, undock ship, fly the ship to the next location. | Gun&ammo, spare parts, bottles, ores.<br><br>Starter Ship with Survival Kit | Enable the Survival Kit on the starter ship. You can process stone to produce some spare parts in the Survival Kit. |
| Ship Tools | Assembler, power generation, ship grinder, ship welder | Repair and use a utility ship, use an H2 Engine to produce power, use welder/grinder to force-open doors | Utility ship<br><br>Uranium, spare parts, medical components | Also enable the Survival Kit. |
| Ship Mining | Ship drills | Repair a ship, use ship drills | Miner ship<br><br>Ores | Get ores here. |
| Ship Building | H2 Generator, H2 Tank, cryo pod | Add blocks to a ship frame to finish it | Ion fighter ship<br><br>Medical components, ammo, thruster components | Also enable the Survival Kit. |
| Remote Control | Drones | Control a drone | Drone Blueprint | Send drones while you stay safe. |
| Projectors | Projector | Use a projector as a 3D Printer | Ammo | Use this method to print drones. |
| Production | Refinery, Assembler | Refine Ores, repair a factory, produce components | Spare parts, iron ingots | Use factories to produce all the parts you need. |
| Pressurization | O2/H2 Generator | Pressurise an airtight room | Spare parts, ice | Use this method to extend your life support. |
| Jump Drive | Jump drive, gravity generator | Repair the jump drive to fly to the revealed coords. | Jump Ship<br><br>GPS of Hidden Base | Use this method to travel long distances. |
| Hydrogen Thrusters | Hydrogen Thrusters | Mine ice | Hydro Miner Ship | Restock ice |

## Tips (Spoilers)

*   Long travel times? Use a ship with Jump Drive.
*   Too much back and forth travel? You are not tied to the pre-built task locations! After completing a task, you can dismantle any locations and rebuild the machines wherever they would be easier to reach for you.
*   Running out of power? Switch off e.g. Gravity Generators to save power. Jump Drives need more power the higher the mass of the ship. Hydrogen Engines need huge tanks, and reactors have more mass than Solar Panels but produce power much faster… Experiment and get an intuition for the right balance for each situation.
*   It’s useful to have a central base or mothership that can do “everything”. But a base cannot travel, and you wouldn’t want to fly your one mothership into battle... Think about specialisation: With your goals and in your situation, what is better done at the base, and what is better done by a ship? And what is better done by remote controlled drones?
