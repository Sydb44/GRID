The MiniMerchant floating above the moon

## Description

Since it has no jump drive of its own, it is recommended to attach it to a larger ship with ion thrusters and using the MiniMerchant to haul your goods from the larger space ship to a ground station.

It can be bought at [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") owned by a [builder faction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions").
