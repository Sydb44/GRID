# Spawn Menu - Official Space Engineers Wiki

## Navigation menu

### Search

(#searchInput)

The Spawn menu is a creative tool that allows Admins to spawn in items and “cheat in” game objects for free.

In Survival Mode, use the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") to give yourself Creative Tools. The Spawn menu can then be accessed by pressing [SHIFT+F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") while a game is running. As a mnemonic, think S as in Spawn uses ShiftKey.

## Spawn items

1.  If you want to spawn [items](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item") into a cargo container, make sure to target the inventory port with the crosshairs before opening the menu.
2.  Select the item from the list, then enter the amount.
3.  If you want to spawn them into a container, verify that at the bottom, it says "current target" and the right container.
4.  Then click **Spawn object** or **Spawn Object into targeted container**, respectively.
5.  If you did not target a container, the items will float in front of your hand. Press [F key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") if you want to pick them up.

## Spawn predefined asteroids

One situation where you may want to spawn in an asteroid is when you create your own [Sandbox Game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game").

Select an asteroid from the list and then choose to either keep its original material, or choose another option. Then click **Spawn**.

To add ores to custom asteroids, use [Voxel Hands](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Voxel_Hands "Voxel Hands").

## Spawn procedural asteroids

This feature is not typically used by Adminstrators.

## Spawn planets

This option is useful when a new release or a Workshop mod adds new [Planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") to the game, and you want to add them to an existing world.

1.  If it’s a [Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") game: Press Alt+F10 and enable **creative mode tools**, then press Alt+F10 to close the Admin Screen again.
2.  Copy the GPS of the planet from the [Planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") table above.
3.  Press K, open the [GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS") tab in game, and click "New From Clipboard". — Or pick a location of your choice
4.  Press F8 to go into [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode") and travel to the new GPS. Tip: Use shift+mousewheel to increase your flying speed.
5.  Press Shift+F10 to open the Spawn menu, and select "Planets" from the drop-down.
    1.  Select the planet or moon to add. (Do not select the ones that say "tutorial" or "example" or "test".)
    2.  Select its size (use the diameter from the [Planets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets") table).
    3.  Click Spawn.
6.  Press Shift-F10 again to close the Spawn menu.
7.  In a Survival game: Press Alt+F10 again and disable creative mode tools.

A planet doesn't have to be spawned in the exact standard position to work.

## Spawn empty voxel map

A voxelmap without any voxel content, useful for making your own voxel designs from scratch using [Voxel Hands](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Voxel_Hands "Voxel Hands").
