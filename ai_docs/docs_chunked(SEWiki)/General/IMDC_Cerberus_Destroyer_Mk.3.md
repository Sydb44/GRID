The IMDC Cerberus Destroyer MK.3 is an old, currently removed NPC ingame [random encounter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Old_Random_Encounters "Old Random Encounters").

## Description

The firepower of a demon behind a hulled white body. Although sailing by automatic control, do not approach like you would with a drone. When the player approaches, it becomes alert, the door is blocked and the turret is activated. An anti-personal turret is installed in most rooms and it is extremely dangerous to infiltrate alone.

Missiles will fly from any direction, but there is a weak point at the back of the ship. It is an armed Destroyer that when attacked spawns a craft known as IMDC Vulture Fighter Bomber.

This ship is constructed of 4041 blocks, and is armed with 14 interior turrets, 4 Gatling Turrets and 7 Rocket Launches. The front of the ship has 5 Rocket Launchers which can be controlled by the player.

From information obtained from the game files the ship will be stationary but will automatically gain speed using a remote control and programming block. Most likely it also has an escape waypoint similar to smaller craft.
