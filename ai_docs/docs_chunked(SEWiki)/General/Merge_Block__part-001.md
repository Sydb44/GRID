A pair of  [![Icon Block Merge Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/8/87/Icon_Block_Merge_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Merge_Block.png?d1b226)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block") Merge Blocks can merge two [ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") of the same size into one, either temporarily or permanently. It can also merge [Large Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") onto [stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Station "Station").

*   Only the sides with clamps can merge. If, in addition to the Merge Blocks themselves, any **full block surfaces** of the two grids touch, use of the merge blocks will _permanently_ bind the grids as one -- which is great for fixing broken and detached grids.
*   If, apart from the Merge Blocks, only **slopes or edges** of the two grids touch, then the merge is _temporary_ -- which is great for modular builds and airtight hangar doors.

## Usage

Using merge blocks to add hot-swappable temporary attachments to a mothership

*   Merge Blocks can be used to [dock and undock](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Docking "Docking") ships and [PBWs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Built_Weapons "Player Built Weapons").
*   Merge blocks can form an airtight seal.
*   Merged grids can be accessed from a [Cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") on either part as if it were all one grid.
*   Merge Blocks can temporarily attach and detach (merge and unmerge) modular block tools or block weapons that are to be used for a time and then swapped out, such as a [Drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drill "Drill") or [Rocket Launcher](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket_Launcher "Rocket Launcher") attachment.
*   Merge Blocks can permanently glue together grids that have detached or broken in two. Only merging lets you recreate the permanent structure needed to hold grids together, which is not otherwise possible. In this case, you don’t want to unmerge again, so just grind off the Merge blocks when you’re done.

### How do merge blocks differ from other blocks?

[![A large and a small Merge Block.](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/f/fb/Merge-blocks.png/320px-Merge-blocks.png?412070)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Merge-blocks.png)

A large and a small Merge Block. Note the clamps indicating the front.

*   A Merge Block is different from a [Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") in so far that it does not extend the conveyor system.  
    (If you additionally need inventory access, you’ll still need to build Conveyors or Connectors on your merged grids.)
*   In contrast to attaching two grids through [rotor](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") and rotor head, a merged grid is one mass and easy to handle in flight, whereas using rotors forms subgrids whose mass throws off the [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers").
*   Merge Blocks placed to form a seal turn two airtight grids into one [airtight](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") grid, whereas subgrids alone are never airtight.

### Prerequisites Check / Troubleshooting

*   Both grids must be of the same size: either small+small or large+large
*   You must have control over at least one of the grids: Either it must be flyable, or you need a utility ship (tug) with magnetic landing gear that can lift the grid into position.
*   You need [ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") or faction permissions for both grids, for example by [hacking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking"), or by transferring both grids to "nobody".
*   The two grids to be merged cannot be sibling subgrids connected by only one [rotor, or piston, or hinge](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks"). For example, “grid with merge block - piston - subgrid with merge block” won’t merge. Merging sometimes works when there are levels of indirection and the Merge Blocks are more than one subgrid (e.g. double hinges) apart.
*   If you merge a mobile grid to a static grid, the mobile grid will become static. [Turn the static grid into a "ship" first](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Info_Screen "Info Screen") if you want to stay mobile.
*   You cannot merge captured NPC grids that are unclaimed. See [Claim NPC Ship](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Claim_NPC_Ship "Claim NPC Ship").

### Will it merge permanently or temporarily?

Mastery of the Merge Block is a bit more complicated. If any full block surfaces of the two different grids (other than the merge blocks) touch, use of the merge blocks will _permanently_ bind the grids as one. Even switching off, or grinding off the Merge Blocks will not decouple such merged grids. When repairing a split-in-half ship, such permanent merging is done intentionally.

However, if you make sure that the two separate grids touch each other only with the Merge Blocks, and otherwise at most with thin or pointy edges of blocks (Slopes, Blast Door blocks, or similar), then the two grids can couple and decouple an infinite number of times. When building modular ships or [PBW](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Player_Built_Weapons "Player Built Weapons")/torpedoes, such temporary merging is done intentionally.
