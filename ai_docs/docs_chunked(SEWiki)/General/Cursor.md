## Description

This lightweight scout's hybrid propulsion is comprised of two large atmo thrusters for hovering, launching, and landing in atmospheres; hydrogen thrust for sideways manoeuvrability; plus one Ion booster for forward acceleration in space. Switch the thrusters on and off as needed to not waste energy/fuel!

Being [battery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery") powered, it usually relies on its [connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") and external support ships or carriers to recharge. Although it does not have any cargo containers to store ice, it does contain two [O2 H2 Generators](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") for fast emergency hydrogen production, making it somewhat useful as a medium-range scout craft that can refuel at ice asteroids.

In case the scout is detected or has been assigned a sabotage mission, it is armed with a small-grid [Gatling turret](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gatling_Turret "Gatling Turret"), four fixed [Gatling guns](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gatling_Gun "Gatling Gun"), and one [missile launcher](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket_Launcher "Rocket Launcher").

This ship is available for purchase from [NPC Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") owned by [Builder type factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_Factions "NPC Factions") for around 20,000,000 [Space Credits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Credits "Space Credits"), putting it in a medium price range.

It is suitable for search contracts and lower-level acquisition and escort contracts. It is not effective for hauling cargo or mining trips. If you cannot afford specialised ships that are highly optimised for space/atmosphere, or exploration/battle, this ship is a good allrounder to choose.
