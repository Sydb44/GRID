In contrast to DLCs, the Most Wanted Update is free and preinstalled for everyone who owns the vanilla game. It brought many new block variants into vanilla and also included camera improvements, combat improvementsm, and "quality of life" changes.

> "Our focus in this update was to identify community requested content. Typically, with a major update that also includes premium content, we have a theme or vision and create cosmetics that help realize that vision. This time, the theme, the vision, was simply to review requests and answer as many as possible!" -- Keen Softwarehouse
