SOTF tram B monorail suspension

The large-grid overhead suspension monorail is one of the striking features of the [Sparks of the Future](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sparks_of_the_Future_Scenario "Sparks of the Future Scenario") [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario"). Tram B is the blue one of the two trams on this map, it's the one that connects the Casino with SOTF Central. The interior is decorated with couches and railings.

## Special Features

Tram B travels along a very short monorail track, a straight stalk of blocks, protected by zigzagging beams. It connects the separate Casino asteroid (the one that has a Medical Room and Disco on it, in game it's called "Cascino") with the SOTF Central asteroid. The tram car is loosely clamped to the monorail and it propells itself forward using four [Wheel 1x1s](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_1x1 "Wheel 1x1") that are attached side-ways on the roof, so the tires touch the rail on both sides.

The tram uses the [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") block's [Autopilot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Autopilot "Autopilot") function to travel back and forth between two waypoints. It uses two [Timer Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Timer_Block "Timer Block") and two Autopilot Actions to switch auto-pilot on/off, handbrake on/off, doors open/close, wheels on/off, and to then restart the Timers in a loop.
