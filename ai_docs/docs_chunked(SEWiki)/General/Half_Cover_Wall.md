The  [![Icon Block Half Cover Wall.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Half_Cover_Wall.png/21px-Icon_Block_Half_Cover_Wall.png?2ff9f1)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Half_Cover_Wall "Half Cover Wall") Half Cover Wall is a decorative block in Space Engineers.

## Usage

The Half Cover Wall is a half-height wall useful for taking cover during a small arms firefight. To crouch, press [C key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Unlike the [Full Cover Wall](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Full_Cover_Wall "Full Cover Wall"), it blocks only half of a block side, leaving enough space to walk past. There are also similar [Fire Cover](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Fire_Cover "Fire Cover") variants that may be of interest.

## Construction

This short wall exists for large grid only.

There are two variants with the same recipe: The second variant is called **Half Cover Wall Mirrored** and was added as part of the free [Most Wanted Update](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Most_Wanted_Update "Most Wanted Update").
