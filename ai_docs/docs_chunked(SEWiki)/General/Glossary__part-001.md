# Glossary - Official Space Engineers Wiki

This page contains a glossary of factual terms from astrophysics and astronavigation, as well as fictional terminology from the game Space Engineers.

## A

**Aft:** adj. Located at the rear of a spaceship. Opposite of fore. Example: "I need an aft camera to dock this ship.", "The captain is aft."

**AI:** adj, n. Short for [Artificial Intelligence](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence"), a means of making drone ships and turrets act autonomously.

**Altitude:** n. In aviation, altitude is the craft's height above the ground or sea level. In Space Engineers, it's the height above the terrain.

**Asteroids:** n. Clusters of small non-round planet-like objects on a stable shared orbit inside a star system. Can be made up of ice, rock, or ores.

**Attitude:** n. In aviation, attitude is the orientation (pitch and roll) of the craft relative to a planet's horizon. To stabilise your attitude, you need gyroscopes.

## B

**Berth:** n. The parking place of a starship in a hangar; the astronaut’s bed in the crew cabin.

**Bow:** n. The outer front end of the ship. Opposite of stern. Example: "The bow hit the connector."

**Bridge:** n. The cabin in a large spaceship from where the captain oversees the vessel and commands the crew.

**Burn:** v, n. The activation of one or more [thrusters](#thruster).

## C

**Coast:** v. A medium-range fuel-saving transfer manoeuvre in space. Accelerate the spaceship (or jetpack) to travel speed, stop burning, switch off [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers"), and use inertia to drift at constant speed towards the target. To brake, switch Dampers back on and possibly do a "flip-and-burn".

**Cockpit:** n. The cabin from which the pilot steers the spaceship.

**Collector Pit:** n. An array of conveyored [Collectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector") built so that floating items from a salvage site or space battlefield are sucked into cargo. On planets, it uses natural gravity, and in space, artificial gravity. Often combined with a Grinder Pit.

**Clang:** v, n. The last sound an engineer hears before meeting their lord and destructor, and in extension, the name of the invisible higher power in game. A euphemism for game physics bugs. Also spelled [Klang](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Klang "Klang"). Examples: As a noun, “My hangar doors have become an offering to almighty Klang”, or as a verb, “My refuelling arm clanged out”.

**Clang Drive:** n. An expert exploit using the unintended side-effects of game physics glitches to accellerate and steer a spaceship, instead of using thrusters.

**[Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"):** n. A game mode where players can build without material cost, shoot without ammo, and they cannot die. Opposite of Survival Mode.

## D

**Distal:** adj. Of two subgrid blocks, the one further away from the main grid. Opposite of proximal. Example: "Reverse the distal piston!"

**Dorsal:** adj. Located on the top side of a starship. Opposite of ventral. Example: "We lost the dorsal turrets in the attack".

**Drone:** n. An unmanned vehicle engineered to perform a scientific, military, or civilian task without the presence of a pilot. It relies on [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control"), [Artificial Intelligence](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence"), or [Autopilot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Autopilot "Autopilot").

## F

**Fore:** adj. Located on the front side of a starship. Opposite of aft. Example: "Use the fore camera to aim the railgun."

**Flip-and-Burn:** n. A braking manoeuvre in science fiction. Same as retrograde thrust.

**The Functional Line:** n. When you face a block with a welder in hand and look at the construction tooltip in the top right, a red horizontal marker separates the optional (above) from the required components (below). This is the functional line. Example: "To advance [Progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression"), grind the Landing Gear _below functional_ and reweld it."

## G

_**g**_ or [**g-force:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force) - Acceleration unit where 1 _g_ is 9.81 m/s2 in this game, which is the real Earth's gravity acceleration (9.80665 m/s2) rounded up.

**[GPS](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/GPS "GPS"):** n. Galactic or Global Positioning System. Three numbers that tell you where a static point is in 3D space. In game, locations on planets and space stations are static.

**Gravity Drive:** n. A gravity drive uses [Artificial Mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Artificial_Mass "Artificial Mass") blocks and [Gravity Generators](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator") on the same ship to move the ship without any thrusters.

**Greeble:** v. To decorate a featureless surface by adding detail and depth. n. The non-functional blocks repurposed as sci-fi decorations. Originally used in film studios by Star Wars ship modellers. Examples: "Stop greebling!", "Many greebles where lost in the collision, but the ship remained functional."

**Grid:** n. [Building blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") in the game are arranged on a grid. In extension, any block structure you build, such as spaceships, rovers, [stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Station "Station"), [Mechas](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Walker "Walker"), etc. is referred to as a [grid](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid"). We distinguish mobile grids and [stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Station "Station"), and [small](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid") and [large](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid") grids.

**Grinder Pit:** n. An array of conveyored [grinders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_Block "Grinder Block") built so that wrecks exposed to the combined area of effect are salvaged quickly. See also welder wall or collector pit.

**Gyro:** n. A  [![Icon Block Gyroscope.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Gyroscope.png/21px-Icon_Block_Gyroscope.png?c8eb45)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") [Gyroscope](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope") is a device used for stabilisation and control of attitude rotation (pitch, yaw, and roll) of a ship, vehicle, or walker etc.
