The constructor ship with grinder and welder was one of the first included ships (2014).

Grinding a block removes it from the grid and returns the components into your inventory. If your inventory is full, components drop to the ground or float away in space, so beware.

Before grinding a block, verify that the block is not the only thing holding two halves of the grid together, so the grid does not break in two. (If that happens, fix it with [Merge blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block").)

Players use [handheld grinders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_\(Tool\) "Grinder (Tool)") and ships can use [Grinder Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder_Block "Grinder Block").

## Basic Building Rules

### How to start building a mobile or static grid

The placement of the first block determines whether it will be a mobile or static grid.

**To start building a static grid:**

1.  Select any _large-grid_ block from the Toolbar, such as a Light Armor Block.
2.  The first block placed must intersect with voxels, such as asteroids or planet terrain.

**To start building a mobile grid:**

1.  Select either a large- or small-grid [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") from the toolbar and place it as first block.
2.  _No_ blocks of a mobile grid can intersect with voxels.
3.  After building, grind off the initial Landing Gear, it is just used to stabilise the mobile grid while building.

### How to add power

If you want functional blocks to work (and not just use them as decorations), add [Power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power") blocks.

*   All touching blocks of a grid carry electricity, no cables are needed.
*   Note that Hydrogen engines and thrusters require a small amount of power to pull the Hydrogen fuel from tanks through conveyor ports.

### How to transport items through conveyor tubes

To facilitate the transport of items and gases between functional blocks, build a [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system") on your base or ship.

Conveyors are useful if you need to move:

*   [Ores](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ores "Ores") from drills into refineries,
*   [Materials](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Material "Material") from refineries into assemblers,
*   [Components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component") from assemblers into [Welder Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder_Block "Welder Block"),
*   [Ammunition](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ammunition "Ammunition") into [turrets](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons"),
*   [Hydrogen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") and [Oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") gasses into tanks or into the [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room"),

... or in general, any items into [cargo containers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cargo_Container "Cargo Container").

**Tip:** Conveyors also give you the ability to drag and drop [Items](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item") on the [inventory screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory "Inventory")!

Blocks with conveyor access have visible yellow **[ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port")**. Keep an eye on where the ports are when placing functional blocks: To link blocks into the conveyor system, either place them so that their ports touch, or connect the ports with  [![Icon Block Conveyor Tube.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Conveyor_Tube.png/21px-Icon_Block_Conveyor_Tube.png?1768a0)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Tube "Conveyor Tube") [Conveyor Tube](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Tube "Conveyor Tube")s.

### How to make a grid mobile

Add the following blocks to build a mobile grid:

1.  To be able to turn (yaw left and right), or to level (pitch up or down) a mobile grid by moving the mouse, add [gyroscopes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope").
2.  To control a mobile grid as the player, add a [cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") block (or a [Remote Control](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Remote_Control "Remote Control") or [Automaton](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Automaton "Automaton") Block).
3.  To be able to accelerate and steer a mobile grid using the WASD keys, add one of the following mobility block types:
    *   Either [thrusters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Thruster "Thruster") in all six directions,
    *   or [wheels and suspensions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wheel_Suspension "Wheel Suspension"),
    *   or [mechanical legs](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks").

For all planetary vehicles and walkers: Keep the Center of Mass low and the wheelbase wide. Place heavy blocks like batteries and cargo containers low between the wheels to prevent flipping.
