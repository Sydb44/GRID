Challenge your friends in a well-programmed coop/PvP infantry battle arena! This [scenario](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scenario "Scenario") is intended to be played by three competing factions, Red, Green, and Blue, with four players each. Even though this scenario is a testing ground for hand-held weapons from the Warfare 1 Update, shooting everyone does not win you the game. You can only win if you cooperate with your team mates and complete the objectives within the time limit.

## Should I play it?

The scenario has clearly explained objectives and is suitable for beginners who know basic interactions (moving, using weapons, and interacting with blocks). No driving, flying, nor building skills required.

Intermediate and advanced players will have the slight advantage of recognising items/blocks more quickly, and maybe having more experience with shooting.

## Start

The walled-in arena is roughly shaped like a Reuleaux triangle and floats above the void. The lobby floats above the center of the map like a flying saucer.

Players start in the lobby with tools, a pistol with ammo, and 1 [Medkit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medkit "Medkit"). After twelve players have joined, they get divided up and beamed down into the three faction headquarters.

On the map, each team starts in its team headquarters; locate your team's broken escape pod and assembler. Materials, weapons, and ammo will randomly appear on neutral ground outside the three competing headquarters. Uranium spawns in one location only.

[Jetpacks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") are disabled!

## Objectives

The scenario has multiple strategic objectives that all contribute to winning:

*   Be the _first_ faction to repair (weld up) your unfinished escape pod.
    *   How? Gather materials and assemble repair components in your faction's assembler.
*   Collect the most Uranium from the map center and fuel your escape pod.
    *   How? Protect your allies who are carrying Uranium, they cannot run and their position is revealed.
*   Find and unlock (weld up) jump pads, doors, efficiency modules, speed modules, and ladders in your team's favour.
*   Prevent enemy factions from completing the same objectives.

... all while staying within the time limit.

What are your team members best at? Pick a strategy!

## How to fulfil the minimum player requirement

The main difficulty with this scenario is unfortunately finding enough players. Whenever someone creates a public instance, they need to wait for twelve players, otherwise the match won't even start.

Coordinate with a group of 3, 6, 9, or 12 friends.

To force the game to start with an arbitrary number of players connected, an Admin must use the [Factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") screen to **Add NPCs** to factions to artificially fulfil the starting requirements of 12 players. No NPCs will actually be participating though!

## Trivia

The save game of a Uranium Heist world instance is named "Warfare", which fits the Warfare 1 Update with which it was released.
