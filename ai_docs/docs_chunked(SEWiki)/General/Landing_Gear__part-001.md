 [![Icon Block Landing Gear.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png/21px-Icon_Block_Landing_Gear.png?d381be)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") Landing Gear allows a ship to lock onto any voxel surface and [dock](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Docking "Docking") to most block structures. See also [Magnetic Plate](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Magnetic_Plate "Magnetic Plate") for a more compact variant with the same functionality, and [Large Magnetic Plate](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Magnetic_Plate "Large Magnetic Plate") for a large variant.

## Usage

It's important to configure your [Cockpit Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls") and specify whether you want that pressing [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to cause any landing gear on the ship in proximity to unlock/lock.

Once locked, depending on the size of either ship, when one changes motion, the other will move with it. Locking a ship to a static grid (a station) or voxels (planets or asteroids) will arrest all motion until you unlock.

Landing gears are magnetic and do not require power to lock on to a surface. Make sure to explicitly use the **unlock** action — switching them off is not enough to free yourself.

### Control panel

The landing gear itself has no [terminal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal") [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port").

You can control the following properties of the landing gear from a ship's [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen").

*   Toggle Block on/off manually. Note: When switched off, the magnet will not unlock!
*   Lock and unlock buttons
*   Autolock" checkbox  
    When enabled, the landing gear automatically locks when any object comes into proximity. When disabled, you must use the Lock/Unlock actions manually.

### How to dock to a carrier

Large jump ships can have functional hangar bays where smaller craft can be safely [docked](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Docking "Docking"), smaller ships can also maglock to the outer hull.

After [docking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Docking "Docking") a smaller ship to a carrier, turn off the docked ship’s thrusters and [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers")! Otherwise the docked ship's thrusters will fight the carrier.

### How to undock safely

Consider your inertia: When magnetic locks are disengaged, both ships retain their inertia. It is important to keep this in mind when disconnecting from a ship in motion. For example: when undocking a small ship from a moving carrier, turn on your [Inertial Dampers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inertial_Dampers "Inertial Dampers") right before unlocking the landing gear.

### How to grab grids

A grid can grab a smaller grid by approaching with its landing gear and locking on to it. Then the stronger ship pulls the weaker (or propulsionless) ship with it. At the target, unlock the landing gear to release the tugged grid.

*   Salvage ships use this method to grab wrecks and floating debris like a grapple, and then drop the wrecks into grinder pits.
*   Tug ships with landing gears can position salvaged blocks (such as batteries) precisely next to their Merge Blocks. They can also use landing gear to pull disabled ships through welder pits for repairs, or to haul cargo modules into storage.
*   Boarders and breaching drones similary use landing gear to cling onto enemy ships and follow them.

Tip: The Engineer can push small-grid blocks by bumping into them, but this does not work with large-grid blocks. To push a large-grid block as the Engineer, magnetize a small-grid landing gear to it and push against the landing gear! This works best in low gravity.

### How build a new ship safely

When starting to [build](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") a rover or ship, you don't want it to tip over or float away. Drop a landing gear and start building on it. The Landing Gear will temporarily lock to any surface, even before it has been welded up. This makes landing gear the ideal foundation when building a new mobile grid. You can even build a little teporary tower of blocks on it to lift the grid a bit above ground, so you can e.g. build wheels or the keel more easily.

When the new grid is ready, carefully weld off the temporary landing gear and let the ship stand "on its own feet."

### How to use wind turbines on a mobile base (using Landing Gears)

Mobile large grids cannot use wind power because  [![Icon Block Wind Turbine.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Wind_Turbine.png/21px-Icon_Block_Wind_Turbine.png?e3c447)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wind_Turbine "Wind Turbine") [Wind Turbine](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wind_Turbine "Wind Turbine")s produce power only on stationary bases.

However, wind turbines will work while the grid is made temporarily stationary with landing gear against a stationary grid:

1.  Build turbines on the mobile base. Notice they don't work.
2.  Build a landing gear on the side of the mobile base. Do not use hinges or other mechanical blocks.
3.  Build a small temporary tower of static blocks on the ground in front of the landing gear.
4.  Drive forward and park, locked against the static tower.
5.  The grid is now static. The wind turbines start working and can recharge your batteries.

When you want to start driving again, unlock the Landing Gear, grind off the little tower, and become a mobile grid again. The wind power will stop again.
