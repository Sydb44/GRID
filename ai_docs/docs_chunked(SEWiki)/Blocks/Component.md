**Components** are the subset of [items](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item") that are used in Survival Mode to [construct (weld)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") the [blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block") that compose ships and stations. Grids are made of blocks, blocks are made of components, components are made of materials, materials are made of ores.

Components are acquired by crafting them from refined materials in an [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler"), or by salvaging them from existing blocks using a [Grinder](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder "Grinder"), or looted from the inventories of container blocks onboard [Pre-Built Ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Pre-Built_Ship "Category:Pre-Built Ship").
