The  [![Icon Block Connector.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Icon_Block_Connector.png/21px-Icon_Block_Connector.png?30a126)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector") Connector is a functional [block](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block "Block") in Space Engineers. Ships can use connectors to temporarily connect to the conveyor system of other ships or stations. It can secondarily also eject items, then it is called Ejector. For a tiny variant, see [Small Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Connector "Small Connector"). For an encased variant, see [Inset Connector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Inset_Connector "Inset Connector").

Important: To configure what the Connector does when you press [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"), see [Cockpit Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls").

Seven Connectors: Inset or cylindrical, large or small conveyor size, large or small grid size

## Usage

*   Use a Connector to form a temporary connection between the conveyor and power systems of two docked ships or stations. For access control, see **Trading Mode** below.
*   While not connected, you can use the Connector as an ejector which moves [Items](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item") (stone, gravel) from an inventory into the world.

Connectors are a good way to temporarily connect [Small Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Grid "Small Grid") and [Large Grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Large_Grid "Large Grid"); the connected systems share electricity and [inventory](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"). Blocks within either conveyor system can make push and pull requests as though they were one ship/station. Players can access the terminal and inventories of connected ships and transfer items manually.

### How to eject items

The Connector can secondarily be used to actively release objects into space from a ship's inventory. Enable the **Throw Out** option in its [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen") to turn it into an Ejector.

The ejector function does not work while it's connected to another Connector, there must be enough empty space to deposit the dropped items. If you see an x on the connector ring, the output is blocked.

The Ejector dumps items on the ground or into space, or you can use a [Collector](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Collector "Collector") as a recipient.

### How to dock and recharge

Next to [Landing Gear](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Landing_Gear "Landing Gear") and [Merge Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Merge_Block "Merge Block"), Connectors are your third option for [docking](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Docking "Docking"). A connector on each side is needed to dock a ship to another ship, or to a carrier, or to a station.

*   Similar to landing Gear, Connectors are magnetic in close proximity.
*   In contrast to Landing Gear, Connectors also transfer power, if **Override Power Transfer** is enabled in the settings
*   In contrast to Landing Gear, Connectors also establish a control connection to connected owned grids.
*   Additionally, if the Connector's backside is attached to the [conveyor system](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_system "Conveyor system"), and both sides are powered, Connectors also give the docked ship access to inventories.

You can build docking-only Connectors that have no conveyor system access--just make sure players know which Connector is used for what.

To lock and unlock:

*   Either assign the **Lock/Unlock** toggle action to the [Toolbar](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Tool_Bar "Tool Bar") of your cockpit
*   or click the **Lock/Unlock** button in the Connector's [Control Panel Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel_Screen "Control Panel Screen"),
*   or press [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").

Important: On a carrier at a space station, when you press [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to undock the carrier itself, you _do not want_ to undock all carried ships! You must configure the [Cockpit Controls](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit_Controls "Cockpit Controls") of the hangar Connectors on your carrier so that pressing [P key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") is _not_ used for “parking”.

The owner of a Connector can also define an **Auto-unlock time** after which docked grids are disconnected.

Tip: After unlocking, the electromagnets are inactive for a few seconds to give you time to move out of range. If the magnets are too strong for a small ship, decrease the **strength** value on the control panel screen.
