4.  Tubes with red status lights? The grid needs power!
5.  Tubes with yellow status lights? Grid has power but these tubes are not connected on one or both ends.
    *   Is the line of tubes disrupted or damaged?
    *   Make sure that hinge parts / piston heads / rotor heads are also fully welded. Make sure you use [Advanced Rotors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Advanced_Rotor "Advanced Rotor") and not basic ones.
6.  Tubes with green status lights? They are connected and powered.  
    The problem must lie elsewhere:
    *   Are you trying to transfer large items (e.g. most components) through small ports? Won't work.
    *   Does the target inventory only accept specific item types? E.g. an Assembler will never accept ores.
    *   Is there a Conveyor Sorter that has your item blacklisted, or, not whitelisted?

Note that not all blocks of the conveyor system have coloured status lights -- e.g. [Mechanical Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") and Junctions don't.

Examples for why your inventories could be full are rocks accumulating during mining, and gravel clogging the Survival Kit/Refinery. If your inventories are often full and overflowing, consider using the Ejector function of [Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector").

The [Heavy Industry Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Engineers_-_Heavy_Industry "Space Engineers - Heavy Industry") contains [Industrial Conveyor Pipes](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Industrial_Conveyor_Pipe "Industrial Conveyor Pipe"). They are aesthetic variants of conveyor tubes that look rounded like pipes. The functionality and mount points are identical to the standard tubes.

As a retroactive Heavy Industry DLC update in 2023, the stylish **Conveyor Pipe Cap** was added to cover up open conveyor ports. It is a functionally identical rounded variant of the standard [Conveyor Cap](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Cap "Conveyor Cap").
