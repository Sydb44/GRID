Small conveyor systems fit to SG ships designs more easily and have a much smaller profile. Small Conveyors are frequently used on SG mining ships (owing to the cheap SG  [![Icon Block Drill.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/3/32/Icon_Block_Drill.png/21px-Icon_Block_Drill.png?a1b524)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drill "Drill") [Drill](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Drill "Drill") having three small ports), and fighters [Block Weapons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Weapons "Block Weapons") that are fed with ammo through a small [port](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") (in contrast to  [![Icon Block Rocket Launcher.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/77/Icon_Block_Rocket_Launcher.png/21px-Icon_Block_Rocket_Launcher.png?b2064b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket_Launcher "Rocket Launcher") [Rocket Launchers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket_Launcher "Rocket Launcher") that must be reloaded manually).

Large conveyors on a SG ship increase the profile of the ship, but are unavoidable when the ship must be able to transport large components or rockets: For example, SG Constructor Ships that use  [![Icon Block Welder Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/4/41/Icon_Block_Welder_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Welder_Block.png?2e0da4)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder "Welder") [Welders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Welder "Welder") and  [![Icon Block Grinder Block.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/73/Icon_Block_Grinder_Block.png/21px-Icon_Block_Grinder_Block.png?88a55d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder "Grinder") [Grinders](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grinder "Grinder"); or SG Fighters using  [![Icon Block Reloadable Rocket Launcher.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/6/66/Icon_Block_Reloadable_Rocket_Launcher.png/21px-Icon_Block_Reloadable_Rocket_Launcher.png?c738bc)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Reloadable_Rocket_Launcher "Reloadable Rocket Launcher") [Reloadable Rocket Launchers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Reloadable_Rocket_Launcher "Reloadable Rocket Launcher").

With its 3x3 SG blocks wide tubes, large conveyors have trouble fitting next to 1- and 2-SG-block wide gaps; use  [![Icon Block Conveyor Frame.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/3/39/Icon_Block_Conveyor_Frame.png/21px-Icon_Block_Conveyor_Frame.png?2921e5)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Frame "Conveyor Frame") [Conveyor Frame](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Frame "Conveyor Frame")s to adapt the large system more easily to a variety of SG ship designs.

## How to transition between large and small SG ports?

You can use large and small conveyor blocks on the same small-grid (SG) ship. However, [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") of different sizes cannot connect directly to one another.

An example of a large grid block that can convert between large and small is the  [![Icon Block Conveyor Junction.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/c/c4/Icon_Block_Conveyor_Junction.png/21px-Icon_Block_Conveyor_Junction.png?500970)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Junction "Conveyor Junction") [Conveyor Junction](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Junction "Conveyor Junction"). Several other SG blocks, such as the  [![Icon Block Conveyor Converter.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/f/f6/Icon_Block_Conveyor_Converter.png/21px-Icon_Block_Conveyor_Converter.png?e0ddc1)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Converter "Conveyor Converter") [Conveyor Converter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Conveyor_Converter "Conveyor Converter"),  [![Icon Block Medium Cargo Container.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/c/ce/Icon_Block_Medium_Cargo_Container.png/21px-Icon_Block_Medium_Cargo_Container.png?5e0039)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medium_Cargo_Container "Medium Cargo Container") [Medium Cargo Container](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medium_Cargo_Container "Medium Cargo Container"),  [![Icon Block O2 H2 Generator.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/7e/Icon_Block_O2_H2_Generator.png/21px-Icon_Block_O2_H2_Generator.png?60936f)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator") [O2 H2 Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator"),  [![Icon Block Oxygen Tank.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/f/f2/Icon_Block_Oxygen_Tank.png/21px-Icon_Block_Oxygen_Tank.png?1d5a4b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Tank "Oxygen Tank") [Oxygen Tank](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Tank "Oxygen Tank"),  [![Icon Block Fighter Cockpit.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/b/b4/Icon_Block_Fighter_Cockpit.png/21px-Icon_Block_Fighter_Cockpit.png?e570b4)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Fighter_Cockpit "Fighter Cockpit") [Fighter Cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Fighter_Cockpit "Fighter Cockpit"),  [![Icon Block Cockpit.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/a/a5/Icon_Block_Cockpit.png/21px-Icon_Block_Cockpit.png?c799da)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") [Cockpit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit"), have [ports](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Port "Port") for both the large and small system and can "convert" between large and small conveyors.

Connecting conveyors to two ports on these dual-use blocks lets _small_ items (such as ores) travel across the whole system, if desired. It still does not enable you to move _large_ items through _small_ ports though!

## Troubleshooting Conveyor Systems

There are some frequently occurring causes why you are not able to transfer items between inventories.

Check the following things:

1.  Does the grid have power?
2.  Is the target container too full?
3.  Are Containers/Junctions really fully welded?
4.  Tubes with red status lights? The grid needs power!
5.  Tubes with yellow status lights? Grid has power but these tubes are not connected on one or both ends.
    *   Is the line of tubes disrupted or damaged?
    *   Make sure that hinge parts / piston heads / rotor heads are also fully welded. Make sure you use [Advanced Rotors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Advanced_Rotor "Advanced Rotor") and not basic ones.
6.  Tubes with green status lights? They are connected and powered.  
    The problem must lie elsewhere:
    *   Are you trying to transfer large items (e.g. most components) through small ports? Won't work.
    *   Does the target inventory only accept specific item types? E.g. an Assembler will never accept ores.
    *   Is there a Conveyor Sorter that has your item blacklisted, or, not whitelisted?

Note that not all blocks of the conveyor system have coloured status lights -- e.g. [Mechanical Blocks](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_Blocks "Mechanical Blocks") and Junctions don't.

Examples for why your inventories could be full are rocks accumulating during mining, and gravel clogging the Survival Kit/Refinery. If your inventories are often full and overflowing, consider using the Ejector function of [Connectors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Connector "Connector").
