Approaching the well protected logistics facility

The Logistics Facility is an [Encounter](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Global_Encounters "Global Encounters") with [the Factorum](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Factorum "The Factorum").

## Spoilerfree description

This encounter is set in a large space station that is surrounded by many floating cargo containers. The logistics facility is aggressively defended by the Factorum because [valuable technology](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech "Prototech") is stored there. The station is "all business" and armories, there don't seem to be barracks or a galley for staff to stay longer.

**Spoiler warning!**  
This article or section contains details about the game which players may be intended to discover on their own!

## Spoilers

### Map

The station has lots of long horizontal open hallways and scaffold passages that meet in the middle. The core section is tall with several floors and many ladders and stairs. One of the longer hallways is suspended by impressive "chains" on angled hinges but it easily gets destroyed in battle.

### Drones

*   High Profile Escort
*   M2-Barrage
*   Reclaimer

### Traps

*   Lots and lots of battle drones
*   interior turrets
*   When you approach, a Broadcast Controller threatens with self destruction - if you have turrets set to aim at weapons, they hopefully destroy the warheads before the countdown runs out.

### Loot

*   Large-grid [Prototech Refinery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Prototech_Refinery "Prototech Refinery") encased in blocks
*   Prototech ...?
*   ores, materials, components
*   Check the barrels, freights, cargo containers, most contain loot
