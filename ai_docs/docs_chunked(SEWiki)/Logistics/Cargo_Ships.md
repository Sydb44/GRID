[Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Encounters "Encounters") provide players with exploration and PvE content (player versus environment). NPC-controlled ships spawn randomly when you have the _Cargo Ships_ option enabled in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

## Cargo Ships

If you manage to capture a cargo ship, you can loot its cargo and salvage the ship. Or you can [hack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hacking "Hacking") and restore and use it, for example, in a custom [Space Suit Only Survival](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Space_Suit_Only_Survival "Space Suit Only Survival") scenario.

Cargo ships are owned by NPC factions. The more you attack them, the more it will affect your [faction standing](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions").

## Behaviour

The ships appear near a player or near [Trading Outposts](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Trading_Outposts "Trading Outposts") and pass by neutrally as long as the players keep their distance. If players or their ships come too close and attempt piracy, the cargo ships' defensive turrets will open fire. As long as the ships' antennas still work, they also call defense drones for backup.

## Types

The ships fall into six categories, which can be identified by their color scheme and themes in both construction and naming. As expected, Military and Pirate cargo ships are tougher to capture and trader/miner/builder cargo ships easier.
