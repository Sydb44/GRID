The Small Cargo Vessel wreckage, with clearly visible warheads on the surrounding asteroids

The Small Cargo Vessel (SCV) is a derelict ship which can spawn if the "[Random Encounters](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Random_Encounters "Random Encounters")" option is enabled in your world. It can be found by following the "[SPRT](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/SPRT_Space_Pirates "SPRT Space Pirates") MAYDAY" signal, which flashes on the player's [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") for 1s every minute, from a distance of ~25 km.

The story behind this encounter is that the ship ran out of fuel due to a navigation miscalculation, and headed towards a nearby asteroid to find some ice. This can be found in the last log in the bridge section. Two dead engineer skeletons can also be found in the wreck.

Occasionally, [salvage drones](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pirate_Salvage_Drones "Pirate Salvage Drones") will also spawn next to the wreck.

## Spoilers

Engineers should approach with great caution, as there are a few still active interior turrets mounted on the ships hull. The ship also often spawns near an asteroidÂ  group, with sensor triggered warheads scattered around it. These could also cause even greater damage to the wreck.

## Contents

Besides the salvageable blocks and components, the intact large cargo containers hold around 20-30k iron ore. It is possible to restore the ship, however it is a real challenge in survival mode. The ship contains multiple decorative DLC block, which will be visible, but cannot be used and will not provide components if destroyed, if the player does not have the DLC installed.
