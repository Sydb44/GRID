# Storage Shelf - Official Space Engineers Wiki

The Storage Shelf is a set of large-grid decorative blocks. Functionally, it is a cheap but limited storage container that displays the components that you put into it and looks different depending on how full it is. Only players who have purchased the [Wasteland Pack](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wasteland_Pack "Wasteland Pack") DLC can build them.
