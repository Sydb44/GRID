# Creative Mode - Official Space Engineers Wiki

)

A [new game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_game "New game") can be in one of two modes, Creative Mode or [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"). In Creative mode, the player does not need to manage resources, which makes it easier to [build](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") and prototype ships, rovers, stations, and scenario worlds quickly.

You change the game mode anytime in the [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"), but consider the caveats below. Tip: Switch off any processing blocks before switching.

## What is different in Creative Mode?

Creative Mode has the following features:

*   Players can [prototype builds](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") fast:
    *   [Place](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Block_Placement_Mode "Block Placement Mode") fully-welded blocks without using up materials.
    *   Mirror what you build using [Symmetry](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") Mode
    *   Players can browse all grids, teleport, or fly through walls in [Spectator Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spectator_Mode "Spectator Mode").
*   Inventory size is unlimited for both the player and blocks with inventories. (See caveat below.)
*   No [Food](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food") Consumption
*   No [Radiation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Radiation "Radiation")
*   No consumables are used up:
    *   Reactors and hydrogen thrusters do not consume fuel.
    *   Players do not take damage and cannot die. They do not consume oxygen / hydrogen / suit energy.
    *   Weapons do not consume ammunition.
    *   Parachute hatches don't use up canvas.
*   Players can create custom [Sandbox Games](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Sandbox_Game "Sandbox Game"):
    *   [Shape the voxels of planets and asteroids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Voxel_Hands "Voxel Hands") and add ores.
    *   Copy, paste, delete, or cut whole welded grids and [blueprints](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint"). (See keyboard shortcuts below)
    *   [Spawn in](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Spawn_Menu "Spawn Menu") whole planets, asteroids, stations, ships, items.
*   All NPC [factions](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Factions "Factions") show as discovered.

Note: The _maximum input/output rate_ of tanks and batteries is still capped in Creative Mode, so you still need to build an appropriate number of fuel and power sources, even if they last forever.

## How to copy and paste grids

All [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") can be copied in Creative Mode, as long as copying and pasting is enabled in the [world settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings"). Focus the grid with your crosshairs, then:

*   Press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[C key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to copy the grid.
    *   Press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[C key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to copy only the focused subgrid.
*   Press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to cut the grid (copy the blocks and remove the original). You will see a warning.
    *   Press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[X key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to cut only the focused subgrid. You will see a warning.
*   Press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[V key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to insert what you copied back into the game.
    *   Pasted [Stations](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Station "Station") will align the blocks to the grid from which they were copied.
    *   Pasted Ships can be rotated before they are pasted with the rotation [keys](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings").
    *   Check block ownership after pasting, especially for spawn points and programmable blocks and similar
*   Press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[DELETE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") to delete the targeted grid.
    *   Press [CTRL key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[SHIFT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[DELETE key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings") the targeted subgrid.

## How to build multiple blocks quickly

## Caveats

**Don't lose your inventories:** If you convert a world from Creative to Survival, or paste a Creative build into a Survival world, the lack of Creative inventory limitations has the side-effect that the inventory contents will be truncated back in Survival!

For example, if your Survival world has reactors, refineries, or assemblers running, and you switch it to Creative, they automatically pull all available items into their (now infinite) inventories without you realising it. When you switch back to Survival, you'll get a message that inventories will be truncated, but since you don't remember overfilling any inventories, you click yes, and those pulled items will be truncated. Better power off any processing and reactors before switching to prevent this item loss.

**Don't run out of fuel:** A Creative-designed vehicle used in a Survival game is at risk of running out of fuel --out of power, ammo, canvas, hydrogen-- unexpectedly, if it was never tested or designed for real Survival consumption rates.

For example, an O2/H2 Generator produces "infinite" hydrogen in Creative mode; but in Survival Mode, you won't be able to carry the "infinite" amounts of ice to keep up with hydrogen thrusters.
