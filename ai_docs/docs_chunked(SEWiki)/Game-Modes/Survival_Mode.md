# Survival Mode - Official Space Engineers Wiki

A [new game](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/New_game "New game") can be in one of two modes, [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode") or Survival Mode. In Survival mode, the player must manage resources in order to survive and build. You set the mode in the gameâ€™s [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings").

Managed resources include health, power, oxygen and hydrogen, inventory size, ores, materials, consumables, and components.

In Survival mode, the player can take damage from the [environment](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Environment "Category:Environment") and must be mindful of [deadly](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Death "Death") dangers such as crashing, explosions, falling, freezing, suffocation, (being attacked by spiders or wolves, if these optional features are enabled), or being [shot](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") by turrets or by other players.

In order to be able to [build](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building "Building") anything, the player has to:

1.  Obtain materials, either by looting or by using [Refineries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery"),
2.  then use [Assemblers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") to turn materials into useful [Items](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Item "Item") (such as tools, consumables, and weapons) and [Components](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Component "Component"),
3.  and finally use the components to build stations, rovers, and spaceships out of Blocks.

*   To manage your health, you use a [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit"), [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room"), or [Medkits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medkit "Medkit").
*   To manage [oxygen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") and [hydrogen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen"), you use bottles, [O2/H2 Generators](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/O2_H2_Generator "O2 H2 Generator"), and the [airtightness](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") mechanic for rooms
*   To manage [power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power"), you use batteries and [Powerkits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Powerkit "Powerkit").
*   To manage inventories, you use [Cargo Containers](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cargo_Container "Cargo Container").
*   To manage hunger, consume [Food](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Food "Food").
*   To manage [Radiation](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"), use [Anti-Radiation MedKits](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Anti-Radiation_MedKit "Anti-Radiation MedKit") and the [airtightness](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Airtightness "Airtightness") mechanic for rooms

And so on.

[Ownership](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Ownership "Ownership") plays a role in survival mode because, in contrast to creative mode, you cannot interact with [Terminals](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Terminal "Terminal") and buttons on pirated enemy ships.
