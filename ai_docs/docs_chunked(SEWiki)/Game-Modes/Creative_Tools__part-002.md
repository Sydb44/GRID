## How to build multiple blocks quickly

## Caveats

**Don't lose your inventories:** If you convert a world from Creative to Survival, or paste a Creative build into a Survival world, the lack of Creative inventory limitations has the side-effect that the inventory contents will be truncated back in Survival!

For example, if your Survival world has reactors, refineries, or assemblers running, and you switch it to Creative, they automatically pull all available items into their (now infinite) inventories without you realising it. When you switch back to Survival, you'll get a message that inventories will be truncated, but since you don't remember overfilling any inventories, you click yes, and those pulled items will be truncated. Better power off any processing and reactors before switching to prevent this item loss.

**Don't run out of fuel:** A Creative-designed vehicle used in a Survival game is at risk of running out of fuel --out of power, ammo, canvas, hydrogen-- unexpectedly, if it was never tested or designed for real Survival consumption rates.

For example, an O2/H2 Generator produces "infinite" hydrogen in Creative mode; but in Survival Mode, you won't be able to carry the "infinite" amounts of ice to keep up with hydrogen thrusters.

## Creative Tools in Survival Games

If you are the server admin, or if it is a local singleplayer world, it is also possible to enable Creative Tools (and some other Creative mode features) in a Survival game through the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen") by pressing [ALT key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings")+[F10 key](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Bindings "Key Bindings"). Depending on the settings you choose, you can be on the one hand undying and able to jetpack without limits, while at the same time receiving constant survival warnings about running out of power or hydrogen etc.
