**Note:** In Creative Mode, a battery has infinite stored _charge_, but still limited _throughput_ (input/output)! If a grid exceeds its maximum power usage, you still need to add several batteries, even in Creative Mode.

## Comparisons

### Weight Comparison

When providing power, batteries are more efficient in terms of mass than [Small Reactors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Reactor "Small Reactor") on small ships, but they're only 80% as efficient as reactors in terms of power generated per volume in comparison.

However, in contrast to reactors and hydrogen engines, batteries have the advantage of not requiring a conveyor system to feed them fuel, and as such, they can be fitted in spaces not connected to conveyor systems, or be used for short trips, possibly equaling or even surpassing the power density of a conveyored reactor when used in large banks.

A fully discharged battery is just dead weight until it can be recharged using another power source. This means that large banks of batteries are suboptimal for long distance travel. If the battery is only needed to power a drone or shuttle for 15 minutes or less, the battery's life (and power per weight ratio) is sufficient and you can disregard the dead weight issue.

On small grid, seven [Small Batteries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Battery "Small Battery") weigh as much as 1 standard Battery, while offering only one third of the throughput. If you have enough space, replace these seven by a standard Battery.

### Efficiency Comparison

Renewable [power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power")\-producing blocks (solar panels, wind turbines) are the most efficient for recharging batteries. Given that each kilogram of Uranium ingots generates 1 MWh of power in a reactor, one full charge on a small battery is roughly equal to 0.36 ingots and on a large battery, about 1 ingot. However, recharging batteries with reactors only has a 80% efficiency, meaning you'll need somewhat more uranium to recharge batteries than to fuel a reactor.

Transferring power from one Battery to another is possible, but inefficient (lossy), so only do it in emergencies. For example, it makes sense to transfer the power out of a wreck that you are about to grind down, because it's better to lose 20% than to not salvage the power at all. But don't set up Timer blocks to discharge and recharge batteries in docked ships on the regular.

On small grid, you'd need 20 Small Batteries to get the same throughput as one standard Battery, but they'd have three times the mass and 2 SG blocks larger volume.

## Trivia

Batteries are the densest block in game, they have very high mass for their small volume, even before being welded up.

*   You cannot give a mobile grid "infinite power" by simply building a wall of batteries, because the increased mass will make it too sluggish. Lower the power needs by [building specialised](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Building_Tips "Building Tips") mobile grids instead of a heavy "jack of all trades".
*   When a rover has flipped in Survival Mode, there are different approaches to turn it right-side-up again: One is to shift the [Center of Mass](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Center_of_Mass "Center of Mass") by building a long temporary stalk of (unwelded!) blocks until the vehicle topples back to the other side, and then grind the stalk off. Unwelded Batteries are the block of choice for this solution.

## Construction

If [progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is enabled, build a  [![Icon Block Basic Assembler.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/d/df/Icon_Block_Basic_Assembler.png/21px-Icon_Block_Basic_Assembler.png?8d0c2d)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Basic_Assembler "Basic Assembler") [Basic Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Basic_Assembler "Basic Assembler") first to unlock it.

Batteries exist for small grids in 3x3x2 small blocks size, which makes them quite unwieldy. On large grids, Batteries take up 1x1x1 large blocks of space. For a tiny variant, see [Small Battery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Battery "Small Battery").

Batteries can attach to other blocks on any of the six sides. Immediately after construction, the battery is already charged up to 30% of its capacity, ready to be used by other blocks. No "cables" or ports are needed for this block to provide power to the grid!

Some faces of the block display a charge indicator, so when placing it, consider whether you want to rotate the block for these coloured lights to be visible or not. The large-grid battery has a built-in [Control Panels](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Control_Panel "Control Panel") on the four sides with indicators, the small-grid variant doesn't.

When grinding down a battery, the  [![Icon Item Power Cell.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/3/37/Icon_Item_Power_Cell.png/21px-Icon_Item_Power_Cell.png?29ae8b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power_Cell "Power Cell") [Power Cell](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power_Cell "Power Cell") components become  [![Icon Item Scrap Metal.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/5/5d/Icon_Item_Scrap_Metal.png/21px-Icon_Item_Scrap_Metal.png?9b5187)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scrap_Metal "Scrap Metal") [Scrap Metal](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Scrap_Metal "Scrap Metal"); this means you cannot gain infinite power by grinding and rewelding batteries repeatedly -- you "pay" for the free partial charge in  [![Icon Item Power Cell.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/3/37/Icon_Item_Power_Cell.png/21px-Icon_Item_Power_Cell.png?29ae8b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power_Cell "Power Cell") [Power Cell](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power_Cell "Power Cell").
