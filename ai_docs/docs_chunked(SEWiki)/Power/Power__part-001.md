# Power - Official Space Engineers Wiki

In [Survival Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"), the engineer’s suit [Life Support](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Life_Support "Life Support") and all [grids](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Grid "Grid") (ships, stations, rovers) with functional blocks require power to function.

In [Creative Mode](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Creative_Mode "Creative Mode"), power producing blocks have infinite charge, but still limited throughput. If a grid exceeds its reactor's/battery's power capacity, you still need to build several power producing blocks.

All touching blocks carry electricity, there are no cables to put down.

## Comparison

How do I choose a power source? Each source has benefits and disadvantages regarding mobility, recharge time, effectiveness, location, and costs. A basic rule of thumb is, consider your the [environment](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Environment "Category:Environment") and what is most practical there, before you start building.

## Why do I care?

Don't take lack of power lightly:

*   Without power to your gyroscopes, it will be very hard to do a controlled soft landing!
*   Without powered thrusters, you will drift and you won't be able to slow down and brake your velocity!
*   Without power, conveyors don’t work -- which also prevents hydrogen from being supplied to hydrogen engines and thrusters!
*   Without power, your environmental control (air vents, doors, lights, and artificial gravity) will fail!
*   Multiplayer servers delete unpowered grids, assuming they are floating debris.
*   Life support (recharging your suit) of course also requires power.

## How to recharge a space suit

Engineers recharge their suit’s power by sitting in any seat (which includes couch, toilet, bed) or cockpit on a powered grid, or by interacting with a [Survival Kit](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Survival_Kit "Survival Kit"), [Cryo Chamber](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Cryo_Chamber "Cryo Chamber"), or [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room").

## What's my power usage?

[![The HUD element marked with a lightning bolt is your current power usage.](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/a/a3/HUD-power-in-use.png?6ad7dd)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:HUD-power-in-use.png)

The HUD element marked with a lightning bolt is your current power _usage_, not the remaining charge.

While seated in a grid, your total **power usage** is shown in the bottom-right of the [HUD](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/HUD "HUD") in percent in the powerbar marked with a lightning bolt.

*   If the powerbar is empty, you are not exerting the ship (e.g. because it is docked or powered down).
*   If the powerbar always shows low values even at high exertion, you can remove some batteries/reactors and save weight.
*   If the powerbar fluctuates below 99%, you have just enough power for what you are doing, which is good.
*   If the powerbar fills up to 100% and turns red, your ship lacks the power to perform at the requested level: If this happens regularly, add another battery.
