3,600secondshr∙100L of hydrogenMW per second\=360,000L of hydrogenMWh

  
To produce **1 MWh** with a  [![Icon Block Hydrogen Engine.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/3/34/Icon_Block_Hydrogen_Engine.png/21px-Icon_Block_Hydrogen_Engine.png?7bc9a7)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Engine "Hydrogen Engine") [Hydrogen Engine](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Engine "Hydrogen Engine"), we would need **360,000 L of hydrogen**.

  
From here you take the **MW** your base is consuming and multiply it by the fuel consumption calculation. Since our grid is running at **7.4 MW** and we want to run it for **10 hr** we will need:

360,000L of hydrogenMWh∙10hr∙7.4MW\=26,640,000 L of hydrogen

  
So we would need **26,640,000 L** of hydrogen to run our base at **7.4 MW** consitently for **10 hr**. Since Large Grid [Hydrogen Engines](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Hydrogen_Engine "Hydrogen Engine") have a maximum output of **5 MW**, we would need **two hydrogen engines**.

## How long will my power last?

When logging off a multiplayer server tou want an estimate how long your ships or base's power will last before it will fall victim to server cleanup rules for unpowered grids.

Above the power usage in the HUD, you can also see your **power remaining in minutes** based on that you continue doing what you are doing right now.

*   While docked or coasting, the HUD will show the maximum time remaining.
*   While actively manoeuvering or running all factories etc., it will show the minimum time remaining.

## How to not lose unpowered grids

The game can mistake unpowered grids (e.g. drones and rovers that ran out of batteries) for debris, which prompts the automatic Trash Removal to delete them.

*   In Singleplayer, configure or suspend this feature on the [Admin Screen](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Admin_Screen "Admin Screen").
*   In [Multiplayer](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer"), expect Trash Removal to be the default. Before logging off, set the batteries to Auto, add some type of renewable energy to your grids, and shut down all power-hungry non-essentials such as factories.

If you are willing and able to run [script mods](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Mods "Mods"), Adriano's [Electric Network Info - Touch App](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2917216762) can display current power production and consumption on an LCD in great detail.
