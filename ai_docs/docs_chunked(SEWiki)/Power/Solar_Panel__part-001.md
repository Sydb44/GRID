The  [![Icon Block Solar Panel.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/c/c9/Icon_Block_Solar_Panel.png/21px-Icon_Block_Solar_Panel.png?ded806)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel") Solar Panel uses natural sunlight to produce [power](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Power "Power"). For a shape variant, see [Colorable Solar Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Colorable_Solar_Panel "Colorable Solar Panel").

## Usage

Solar Panels are a cheap source of power in space and in daylight on planets or moons, at the cost of being unwieldy and very fragile. Solar Panels appear on some [Pre-Built Ships](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Built_Ship "Pre-Built Ship"), most prominently the commercial cargo ships.

## Power

No "cables" are needed to convey power. Just connect the Solar Panels with any blocks.

The power grid gives priority to drawing solar power, therefore any reactors on the same ship or station can remain active and will only consume uranium once the power draw exceeds the capacity of both the solar panels and the discharging [Batteries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery").

| Grid | Max Power Output |
| --- | --- |
| Small Grid | 40 kW |
| Large Grid | 160 kW |

### What influences efficiency?

Solar Panels produce power depending upon the angle of exposure to the sun. The optimal angle is at a **90 degrees** to the sun.

*   Any physical object can block sunlight from reaching the panel, _e.g. the shadow of ships and asteroids can potentially render the panels useless as will glass windows._
*   On planets, the sun is blocked for half of the day cycle which precludes power production.
*   In planetary atmospheres, the [weather](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather "Weather") can dim sunlight and reduce power collection.

### What's the current efficiency?

The current efficiency of the panel is indicated by a series of lit squares at the side of each panel.

| Indicator | Efficiency | Description |

| [![Solar power indicator 100.svg](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/c/c6/Solar_power_indicator_100.svg?d8898c)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Solar_power_indicator_100.svg) | 76-100% | **Green indicators** - 4 green lights: There is sunlight; Solar panel is between 76% to 100% efficient. |

## Comparison

One optimally aligned Solar Panel produces enough power to supply a [Medical Room](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Medical_Room "Medical Room"), meaning that you are theoretically independent from uranium in order to survive, given you remain in sunlight.

One [Assembler](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Assembler "Assembler"), one [Refinery](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Refinery "Refinery"), and one [Gravity Generator](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Gravity_Generator "Gravity Generator"), use up to 1,687.13 kW of power, requiring 11 Solar Panels to use all 3 assuming a maximum output of 160 kW per panel.

## Construction

If [progression](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Progression "Progression") is enabled, you can always build solar panels, they do not need to be unlocked.

They have mount points on all sides of both short edges, so as long a short edge touches other surfaces, you can place it.

In order for a solar panel to produce power, build it so that its surface is exposed to direct sunlight. On [planets and moons](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Planets "Planets"), the sun is blocked by the ground for half the day cycle, which prevents solar panels from generating any power at night. If you are relying on solar power, make sure to build enough  [![Icon Block Battery.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/1/13/Icon_Block_Battery.png/21px-Icon_Block_Battery.png?fc3f6b)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery") [batteries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Battery "Battery") to last the night, and enough solar panels to charge the batteries during the day.

Solar panels transfer power through mechanical blocks such as hinges, rotors, and pistons. This means you can build foldable or retractable solar arrays in case you need to protect them during a fight or meteor storm. It is recommended to build solar arrays on a rotor+hinge that slowly rotate 360 degrees in one in-game day (2 real-life hours using the default [World Settings](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Settings "World Settings")) such that the panels always face the sun optimally.

Built on mechanical blocks, you can align Solar Panels manually, you can control them through scripts, or you can use a vanilla  [![Icon Block Custom Turret Controller.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/7/70/Icon_Block_Custom_Turret_Controller.png/21px-Icon_Block_Custom_Turret_Controller.png?49af70)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Custom_Turret_Controller "Custom Turret Controller") [Custom Turret Controller](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Custom_Turret_Controller "Custom Turret Controller") configured to track the sun.
