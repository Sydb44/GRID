## Power

When providing power, batteries are given medium priority. Grids draw power first from  [![Icon Block Solar Panel.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/c/c9/Icon_Block_Solar_Panel.png/21px-Icon_Block_Solar_Panel.png?ded806)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel") [Solar Panel](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Solar_Panel "Solar Panel")s and  [![Icon Block Wind Turbine.png](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/images/thumb/5/5a/Icon_Block_Wind_Turbine.png/21px-Icon_Block_Wind_Turbine.png?e3c447)](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wind_Turbine "Wind Turbine") [Wind Turbine](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Wind_Turbine "Wind Turbine")s, then second from batteries. Reactors are only used if the output of the higher priority options is not sufficient, in order to conserve their uranium fuel.

|     | Max Output | Max Input | Max Stored Power |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small Grid Battery | 4 MW | 4 MW | 1 MWh |
| Large Grid Battery | 12 MW | 12 MW | 3 MWh |

  
**Note:** In Creative Mode, a battery has infinite stored _charge_, but still limited _throughput_ (input/output)! If a grid exceeds its maximum power usage, you still need to add several batteries, even in Creative Mode.

## Comparisons

### Weight Comparison

When providing power, batteries are more efficient in terms of mass than [Small Reactors](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Reactor "Small Reactor") on small ships, but they're only 80% as efficient as reactors in terms of power generated per volume in comparison.

However, in contrast to reactors and hydrogen engines, batteries have the advantage of not requiring a conveyor system to feed them fuel, and as such, they can be fitted in spaces not connected to conveyor systems, or be used for short trips, possibly equaling or even surpassing the power density of a conveyored reactor when used in large banks.

A fully discharged battery is just dead weight until it can be recharged using another power source. This means that large banks of batteries are suboptimal for long distance travel. If the battery is only needed to power a drone or shuttle for 15 minutes or less, the battery's life (and power per weight ratio) is sufficient and you can disregard the dead weight issue.

On small grid, seven [Small Batteries](https://spaceengineers.wiki.gg/wiki/Small_Battery "Small Battery") weigh as much as 1 standard Battery, while offering only one third of the throughput. If you have enough space, replace these seven by a standard Battery.
