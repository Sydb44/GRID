## System Overview

GRID is a sophisticated AI-powered Space Engineers automation system comprising:

- **GRID SE Mod**: Execution engine with 28 specialized controllers, spatial intelligence, safety validation
- **ClaudeBridge Application**: True AI companion interface with Claude LLM for natural language understanding
- **SE Knowledge System**: 393+ commands across 25 SE categories (provides context to Claude AI)
- **Safety Systems**: Zero damage guarantee with comprehensive validation
- **Performance Systems**: 60+ FPS guarantee with scale independence

**Architecture**: User interacts with ClaudeBridge (AI brain) → ClaudeBridge sends structured commands → SE Mod executes safely

## Technical Standards

- **Language**: C# 6.0 compliance throughout
- **SE ModAPI**: Complete interface coverage (385+ interfaces)
- **Performance**: 50 blocks/frame, <1.2s response time
- **Safety**: Zero damage guarantee, crew safety priority
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation framework

## Documentation Status

✅ **Complete and Validated**: All architecture documentation has been systematically validated for:
- Technical feasibility and accuracy
- C# 6.0 compliance
- SE ModAPI constraint adherence
- Performance guarantee achievability
- Safety system completeness
- Implementation detail coverage

This documentation provides complete, accurate information for rebuilding the GRID system from scratch while maintaining all safety standards and performance guarantees.
