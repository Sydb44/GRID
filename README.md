## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Space Engineers** (Steam version)
- **.NET 8.0 Runtime** (for ClaudeBridge)
- **Claude API Key** (from Anthropic Console)

### Step 1: Install GRID SE Mod

1. **Download/Clone** this repository
2. **Create junction link** to SE mods directory:
   ```bash
   mklink /J "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Mods\GRID" "C:\Path\To\GRID_v2\GRID"
   ```
3. **Enable GRID mod** in Space Engineers mod selection
4. **Load any world** - GRID will automatically initialize

### Step 2: Setup ClaudeBridge AI Interface

1. **Get Claude API Key** from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. **Set environment variable**:
   ```bash
   set CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Build ClaudeBridge**:
   ```bash
   cd ClaudeBridge
   dotnet build
   ```

### Step 3: Start AI Companion

1. **Launch Space Engineers** with GRID mod enabled
2. **Load any world** (GRID initializes automatically)
3. **Start ClaudeBridge**:
   ```bash
   cd ClaudeBridge
   dotnet run
   ```
4. **Chat with your AI companion**:
   ```
   🤖 GRID AI: reactor off
   🤖 GRID AI: lights on
   🤖 GRID AI: assembler enable
   ```

## 🎮 Available Commands (Current)

### Universal Block Control
- **Power Systems**: `reactor on/off`, `battery enable/disable`
- **Lighting**: `lights on/off`, `turn off all lights`
